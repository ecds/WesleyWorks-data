            <p>Greg Van Buskirk created Word docs for all of Wesley's sermons using a combination of
                OCR software and manual proofing. Michelle Taylor converted these docx into XML
                using Oxygen's DITA automatic transformation scenario, then touched them up

                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 18-19]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>With <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, I, Wesley could suppose that he had established
                    the basis for his doctrine of justification by faith alone, understood as the
                    threshold of true religion. Taking this then as given—with occasioned short
                    reaffirmations, as in I.3 below—he was free to devote the remainder of his
                    collection to the problems of the ongoing Christian life, from its beginnings in
                    saving faith to its fullness in perfect love. This is evident in the ordering of
                    the sermons; they are out of their chronological sequence, but they have their
                    own logic. Thus, after ‘The Circumcision of the Heart’ Wesley adds a pair of
                    sermons about <hi rend="italic">regeneration</hi>, understood as that act of
                    grace concurrent with justification but not at all identical to it—a ‘vast
                    inward change’ that opens up the lifelong quest for holiness.</p>
                <p n="">In the first of the pair (as also later in No. 45, ‘The New Birth’) Wesley
                    wrestles with an unresolved dilemma in his beliefs and teachings. He had been
                    brought up to take <hi rend="italic">baptismal</hi> regeneration for granted, as
                    in the office for Baptism in the BCP, in Art. XXVII (‘Of Baptism’), and in his
                    father’s ‘Of Baptism’ in <hi rend="italic">The Pious Communicant Rightly
                        Prepared</hi> (1700), which he would thereafter abridge and publish in his
                    own name (1758). John seems always to have believed that <hi rend="italic">something</hi> ‘happens’ in baptism (and in infant baptism at that) that
                    validates its propriety and necessity as the sacrament of Christian initiation;
                    he rejected the logic of ‘believer’s baptism’ which always presupposes
                    ‘conversion’ before baptism.</p>
                <p n="">Even so, his own experience and the dramatic conversions in the Revival had
                    forced on him a recognition of yet another sort of regeneration, more decisive
                    and subjective, more nearly correlated with justification and assurance than
                    with water baptism. Thus, somewhat as he had explained ‘the circumcision of the
                    heart’ as a personal transformation following baptism, so now, in ‘The Marks of
                    the New Birth’ and ‘The Great Privilege of those that are Born of God’ (and
                    again, later, in No. 45, ‘The New Birth’), he was in search of a doctrine of
                    regeneration that would take seriously the realities of evangelical <pb n="416"/>conversions and yet not repudiate his own sacramental traditions. Whether he
                    ever fully succeeded is an open question; it is undeniable that the doctrine of
                    infant baptism as an objective divine action has never had more than a tenuous
                    place in the Methodist tradition. (For a fuller probing of the theological
                    problem of baptism and regeneration, cf. Robert E. Cushman, ‘Baptism and the
                    Family of God’, in Dow Kirkpatrick, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the
                        Church</hi> [New York, Abingdon, 1964], pp. 79-102.)</p>
                <p n="">All this, then, was part of the context of Wesley’s direct concern in these
                    two sermons, the special ‘powers’ (or ‘privileges’, as Wesley prefers to
                    translate ἐξουσία in John 1:12) of justified and regenerated Christians. To this
                    end, he borrows from the analogy of latency from physical birth to point to the
                    latent powers in the human spirit when enlivened by its Creator Spirit (cf. the
                    ‘title’ of the Holy Spirit in the Latin text of the Nicene Creed: <hi rend="italic">Vivificator</hi>). Just as the ‘circumcision of the heart’ had
                    involved ‘humility, faith, hope, and charity’, so also ‘the [distinctive] marks
                    of the New Birth’ are ‘faith, hope, and love’.</p>
                <p n="">In expounding this Christian commonplace, however, Wesley comes, under the
                    heading of ‘faith’, to his crucial assertion that the regenerate believer
                    receives real power (or ‘the privilege’) <hi rend="italic">not to commit
                        sin</hi>, and so to enjoy unanxious peace in heart and mind. Here Wesley
                    comes as close as he ever will to an unnuanced notion of Christian existence as
                    sinless; he even goes on to denounce those who try to qualify this with the more
                    modest claim that the regenerate ‘do not commit sin <hi rend="italic">habitually</hi>’ (I.5). He must have realized, however, that he had laid
                    himself open to misinterpretation, and so he proceeded to add ‘The Great
                    Privilege of those that are Born of God’, and with it a more careful distinction
                    between ‘sin properly so called’ and other shortfallings, i.e., between
                    voluntary and involuntary sins, where ‘voluntary’ sounds suspiciously like
                    ‘habitual’. After that he can develop his metaphor of a spiritual sensorium and
                    his concept of human ‘re-actions’ to divine ‘actions’. This would suggest that
                    the two sermons are better read as a pair than apart.</p>
                <p n="">Both seem to have been written versions of Wesley’s oral preaching, reaching
                    back to the beginnings of the Revival. It is recorded that he had preached from
                    John 3:8 as early as June 10, 1739, and frequently thereafter (fourteen times in
                    all until December 1757). His first recorded sermon from 1 John 3:9 comes on
                    September 23, 1739; a second comes on January 17, 1740; its last usage as a
                    sermon text seems to have been in November 1756. Even in 1748, however, with
                    these twin sermons, Wesley had laid out one of the undergirding premises of his
                    unfolding vision of Christian existence.</p>

                            according to their essential properties, without any consciousness or

                    the Old and New Testament. It is not merely ‘an assent to any, or all these

                    our keeping the first and great commandment—to keep the rest of his
