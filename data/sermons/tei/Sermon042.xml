            <p>Greg Van Buskirk created Word docs for all of Wesley's sermons using a combination of
                OCR software and manual proofing. Michelle Taylor converted these docx into XML
                using Oxygen's DITA automatic transformation scenario, then touched them up
                manually.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment</hi>
                </head>
                <p>The variety and vehemence of the attacks upon his doctrines, and against
                    Christian perfection in particular, never ceased to baffle Wesley. These attacks
                    seemed to him to proceed from a lack of serious interest in the distinctive
                    vision of holy living that he was trying to put into words. Nor could he help
                    being further dismayed by the distortions of that vision that were being spread
                    abroad by some of his own self-professed disciples. There is an illuminating
                    discussion of these problems of misinterpretation on this very point in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Minutes</hi> for June 17, 1747. Clearly, then, the sermon <hi
                        rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi> required yet another sequel which
                    would acknowledge the abuses of the doctrines and also take his critics to task
                    for ignoring the crucial distinction between valid use and illicit abuse. Most
                    of all, Wesley wanted to reduce such dismal janglings by making still further
                    clarifications.</p>
                <p>He had found his clue, of course, in the conviction that the world in general was
                    ruled by Satan and his minions. Cf. No. 12, ‘The Witness of Our Own Spirit’, §10
                    and n. This satanocratic perspective had been shared by the generality of
                    Puritan theologians, but it had been given a special turn by William Spurstowe,
                    better known for his membership in the anti-Laudian group that styled itself
                    ‘Smectymnuus’. One of the discourses in Spurstowe’s <hi rend="italic">Spiritual
                        Chymist: Or, Six Decades of Divine Meditations</hi> (1666) is entitled
                    ‘Σατάνα Νοήματα: Or, the Wiles of Satan’—and this was one of the volumes owned
                    and read by the Holy Club. Spurstowe, of course, had no concern whatever with
                    any notion of Christian perfection; his interest was in pointing out Satan’s
                    alertness in distorting Christian truth in the minds of believers and his
                    effectiveness in annulling the benefits of mere orthodoxy.</p>
                <p>Thus, ‘Satan’s Devices’ is Wesley’s elaboration of this suggestion on the point
                    of sanctification in particular; it is also a warning to his people against
                    Satan’s insinuations in general. He had already preached on 2 Cor. 2:11 four
                    times before 1750 (October 31, 1739; <pb n="02:139"/>December 29, 1740; January
                    18, 1741 [twice]). He would return to it again (May 1, 1774; February 6, 1785;
                    February 9, 1785) with no indication, however, as to which specific ‘device’ he
                    may have had in view on any of these occasions. In the first edition (1750) the
                    sermon has its text without a title; that appears for the first time in <hi
                        rend="italic">Works</hi> (1771), III.232-51.</p>

                    more which we have not. We cannot rightly taste the goodness of God, who hath
                    done so great things for us, because there are so much greater things which as
                    yet he hath not done. Likewise the deeper conviction God works in us of our
                    present unholiness, and the more vehement desire we feel in our heart of the
                    entire holiness he hath promised, the more are we tempted to think lightly of
                    the present gifts of God, and to undervalue what we have already received

                    considerable help not only to inward but also to outward holiness. It
                    strengthens our hands to go on in the work of faith and in the labour of

                    Consequently, whatever damps our joy in the Lord proportionably obstructs our

                    continual tranquility of spirit, the evenness of a mind stayed upon God, a calm
                    repose in the blood of Jesus. And without this it is scarce possible to grow in

                    For all fear (unless the tender, filial fear) freezes and benumbs the soul. It
                    binds up all the springs of spiritual life, and stops all motion of the heart
                    toward God. And doubt, as it were, bemires the soul, so that it sticks fast in
                    the deep clay. Therefore in the same proportion as either of these prevail, our
                    growth in holiness is hindered.</p>
                <p n="8">8. At the same time that our wise adversary endeavours to make our
                    conviction of the necessity of perfect love an occasion of shaking our peace by
                    doubts and fears, he endeavours to weaken, if not destroy, our faith. Indeed
                    these are inseparably connected, so that they must stand or fall together. So
                    long as faith subsists <hi n="02:144"/> we remain in peace; our heart stands
                    fast while it believes in the Lord. But if we let go our faith, our filial
                    confidence in a loving, pardoning God, our peace is at an end, the very
                    foundation on which it stood being overthrown. And this is the only foundation
                    of holiness as well as of peace. Consequently whatever strikes at this strikes
                    at the very root of all holiness. For without this faith, without an abiding

                    love God. ‘We love him because he first loved us;’<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn46" n="46"><p rend="footnote text">1 John 4:19.</p></note> and in
                    proportion to the strength and clearness of our conviction that he hath loved us
                    and accepted us in his Son. And unless we love God it is not possible that we
                    should love our neighbour as ourselves; nor, consequently, that we should have
                    any right affections either toward God or toward man. It evidently follows that
                    whatever weakens our faith must in the same degree obstruct our holiness. And
                    this is not only the most effectual but also the most compendious way of
                    destroying all holiness; seeing it does not affect any one Christian temper, any
                    single grace or fruit of the Spirit, but, so far as it succeeds, tears up the
                    very root of the whole work of God.</p>

                    the expectation of his perfect work. We have seen several of the ways wherein he
                    attempts this by cutting off, as it were, the springs of holiness; but this he
