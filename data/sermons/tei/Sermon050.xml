                <p><hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment</hi></p>
                <p>This sermon completes the series mentioned in the Model Deed of 1763 as ‘the
                    first four volumes of sermons’. It is easily the clearest of Wesley’s summaries
                    of his economic views. The negative premises of those views had already been
                    laid out in No. 28, ‘Sermon on the Mount, VIII’, with its lively critique there
                    of covetousness and of surplus accumulation. Moreover, there are at least
                    twenty-seven oral sermons on Luke 16:9 recorded between 1741 and 1758 (including
                    seven in 1750, six in 1752), and this reflects a constant concern and a
                    perplexing problem. Later, as the Methodists prospered, he would return to the
                    theme again and again, with stern warnings against ‘the dangers of riches’ and
                    with almost pathetic complaints that his warnings were going unheeded. Here,
                    however, we have the live nucleus of an economic view in its entirety, greatly
                    oversimplified but with a prophet’s confidence. None of the elements in his
                    statement is original; this particular combination of them, however, is
                    genuinely so. But there was the rub: on his most original point (the radical
                    rejection of surplus accumulation) his own people preferred the way of the world
                    as stubbornly as any others.</p>
                <p>That world, in Wesley’s day, was largely the creation of an alliance between the
                    new plutocrats of London, Bristol, etc., and the great Whig landed gentry. In
                    ways distortedly described by its anti-bourgeois critics (Max Weber, Werner
                    Sombart, Ernst Troeltsch, R.H. Tawney), this new capitalism had expropriated the
                    so-called ‘Calvinist work ethic’ and had exploited it to advantages that no good
                    Calvinist would ever have approved. As a result there was a steady accumulation
                    of venture capital in Britain and, correspondingly, a shocking contrast between
                    the Georgian splendours of the newly rich and the grinding misery of the
                    perennial poor (not least, those lately uprooted from ancestral villages and now
                    huddled in and around the cities and pitheads). These masses were Wesley’s
                    self-chosen constituency: ‘Christ’s poor’.</p>
                <p>By both birth and breeding Wesley had a deep aversion to ostentation and to
                    arbitrary power conferred by rank or wealth. Conversely, he was deeply committed
                    to a work ethic that saw sloth as sin (even the idleness of <pb n="02:264"
                    />excess sleep) and that condemned self-indulgence as a faithless stewardship of
                    God’s bounties in creation. Labour, for him, was no mere <hi rend="italic"
                        >remedium peccati</hi> (remedy for sin), as it had been for Luther and many
                    medieval moralists, no grim necessity laid on man for that first sin (as Gen.
                    3:17-20 had often been interpreted). Nor did he see money as anything evil in
                    itself. Thrift, industry, honesty, sobriety, generosity were all Christian
                    virtues; their warrants rested in the twin love of God and neighbour, and thus
                    they were included in the agenda of holy living.</p>
                <p>In this sense, Wesley shared a broad tradition of economic discipline and
                    philanthropy long understood as essential in the Christian ethic. Its first
                    premise was the flat rejection of the arrogant notion ‘that men may use their
                    possessions as they list’; this, so ran both medieval and Reformation ethics,
                    was tantamount to atheism.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Cf. John Strype’s analysis of Robert Crowley’s

                            II, Pt. 1, pp. 217-26; Wesley may not have known Crowley, but he knew
                            Strype, and the general idea was already a Christian
                        commonplace.</p></note> The basic ideas of gaining, saving, and sharing the
                    wealth ran back at least to William Perkins.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2"
                        n="2"><p rend="footnote text">See Perkins, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>
                            (1612), I.769; II.150.</p></note> Wesley had so heartily approved the
                    views of Richard Lucas’s <hi rend="italic">Enquiry After Happiness</hi> that he
                    published an abridgement of it in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Library</hi>,
                    Vol. XL (1754), where on pp. 210-15 there is a rough approximation of some of
                    the ideas in ‘The Use of Money’ (but note the differences as well). Four of
                    Archbishop Tillotson’s sermons had dealt with ‘covetousness’ in a tone that
                    recurs in Wesley.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text"
                            >See Tillotson, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.253-74.</p></note> One
                    may also hear echoes from Giovanni Cardinal Bona’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to
                        Eternity</hi> (1709), especially from the chapter on ‘Liberality’ (pp.
                    161-65). Then, too, there had been Jeremy Collier’s strictures on
                    acquisitiveness and economic exploitation in <hi rend="italic">God Not the
                        Origin of Evil…</hi> (1726), pp. 28 ff., and also John Chappelow’s quaint
                    commendations of thrift and generosity in <hi rend="italic">The Right Way to be
                        Rich…</hi> (2nd edn., 1717).</p>
                <p>For all this, however, Wesley’s formula, as summarized here and expounded even
                    more urgently after 1776 in an unavailing counterattack against the huge success
                    of Adam Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi>, has a different final
                    focus than one can find in any of its sources. Work is extolled as honourable, a
                    productive mode of Christian ‘asceticism in the world’. Wesley declines to
                    condemn money or trade or technology. He encourages all reasonable provisions
                    for life’s ‘necessaries and conveniences’ for one’s self and family—this,
                    indeed, is a Christian’s <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>. The difference comes in
                    his insistence on ‘giving <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    <pb n="02:265"/>you can’: an exhortation with so radical an implication that the
                    ordinary conventions of generosity and philanthropy are brought into question.
                    It is as if Wesley regarded surplus accumulation as sinful in itself or as at
                    the least an irresistible temptation to sin. The break here with the economic
                    wisdom of the day (including that of the Quakers) is drastic and deliberate; he
                    challenged his own people, and others, to a more stringent form of self-denial
                    than most of them were prepared for. None of this deterred Wesley, even though
                    he was increasingly dismayed by his inability to persuade the Methodists on this
                    point, as we can see from Nos. 28, ‘Sermon on the Mount, VIII’; 87, ‘The Danger
                    of Riches’; 108, ‘On Riches’; and 131, ‘The Danger of Increasing Riches’; see
                    also Nos. 30, ‘Sermon on the Mount, X’, §26; 61, ‘The Mystery of Iniquity’, §12;
                    63, ‘The General Spread of the Gospel’, §20; 68, ‘The Wisdom of God’s Counsels’,
                    §§8, 16; 80, ‘On Friendship with the World’, §3; 89, ‘The More Excellent Way’,
                    VI.4; 90, ‘An Israelite Indeed’, I.1; 94, ‘On Family Religion’, III.16, 17; 115,
                    ‘Dives and Lazarus’, III; 122, ‘Causes of the Inefficacy of Christianity’, §12;
                    and 126, ‘On Worldly Folly’, I.4.</p>
                <p>Wesley’s self-chosen title for this sermon is as it stands here and in all its
                    successive editions. On at least two occasions, however, he refers to it under
                    the title of ‘The Mammon of Unrighteousness’ (as in his open letter to ‘The St.
                    James Chronicle’, October 29, 1764; and in No. 122, ‘Causes of the Inefficacy of
                    Christianity’, §8, July 2, 1789). For other comments on Wesley’s economic views,
                    cf. Nos. 51, <hi rend="italic">The Good Steward</hi>; and 125, ‘On a Single
                    Eye’.</p>
                <p>On no other single point, save only faith alone and holy living, is Wesley more
                    insistent, consistent—and out of step with the bourgeois spirit of his age. It
                    is, therefore, interesting to note that in E. P. Thompson’s Marxist
                    condemnations of Wesley’s economic and social views as hopelessly reactionary,
                    there is no mention of Wesley’s principled rejection of surplus accumulation;
                    cf. <hi rend="italic">The Making of the English Working Class</hi> (New York,
                    Pantheon Books, 1964), pp. 38-44, 353, 362-63 (‘Wesley appears to have dispensed
                    with the best and selected unhesitatingly the worst elements of Puritanism’),
                    380-81, etc. But see also Bernard Semmel, <hi rend="italic">The Methodist

                    children of God. ‘He said unto his disciples’—not so much to the scribes and
                    Pharisees to whom he had been speaking before—‘There was a certain rich man, who
                    had a steward, and he was accused to him of wasting his goods. And calling him
                    he said, Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer

                    that he used timely precaution—and subjoins this weighty reflection, ‘The

                    procured, and wherein even that which was honestly procured is generally
                    employed. ‘Make yourselves friends’ of this by doing all possible good,
                    particularly to the children of God; ‘that when ye fail’, when ye return to

                        <hi n="02:269"/> bounden duty to do this. We ought to gain all we can gain
                    without buying gold too dear, without paying more for it than it is worth. But
                    this it is certain we ought not to do: we ought not to gain money at the expense
                    of life; nor (which is in effect the same thing) at the expense of our health.
                    Therefore no gain whatsoever should induce us to enter into, or to continue in,
                    any employ which is of such a kind, or is attended with so hard or so long
                    labour, as to impair our constitution. Neither should we begin or continue in
                    any business which necessarily deprives us of proper seasons for food and sleep
                    in such a proportion as our nature requires. Indeed there is a great difference
                    here. Some employments are absolutely and totally unhealthy—as those which imply
                    the dealing much with arsenic or other equally hurtful minerals, or the
                    breathing an air tainted with steams of melting lead, which must at length
                    destroy the firmest constitution. Others may not be absolutely unhealthy, but
                    only to persons of a weak constitution. Such are those which require many hours
                    to be spent in writing, especially if a person write sitting, and lean upon his
                    stomach, or remain long in an uneasy posture. But whatever it is which reason or
                    experience shows to be destructive of health or strength, that we may not submit
                    to; seeing ‘the life is more’ valuable ‘than meat, and the body than
                        raiment.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p rend="footnote text"
                            >Luke 12:23.</p></note> And if we are already engaged in such an employ,
                    we should exchange it as soon as possible for some which, if it lessen our gain,

                <p>2. We are, secondly, to gain all we can without hurting our mind any more than
                    our body. For neither may we hurt this. We must preserve, at all events, the
                    spirit of an healthful mind. Therefore we may not engage or continue in any
                    sinful trade, any that is contrary to the law of God, or of our country. Such
                    are all that necessarily imply our robbing or defrauding the king of his lawful
                        customs.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p rend="footnote text">Cf.

                            Wesley would have none of it.</p></note> For it is at least as sinful to
                    defraud the king of his right as to rob our fellow subjects. And the king has
                    full as much right to his customs as we have to our houses and apparel. Other
                    businesses there are, which however innocent <hi rend="italic">in

                        >now</hi> (at least, not in England): such, for instance, as will not afford
                    a competent maintenance <pb n="02:270"/>without cheating or lying, or conformity
                    to some custom which is not consistent with a good conscience. These likewise
                    are sacredly to be avoided, whatever gain they may be attended with provided we
                    follow the custom of the trade; for to gain money we must not lose our souls.
                    There are yet others which many pursue with perfect innocence without hurting
                    either their body or mind. And yet perhaps <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot:
                    either they may entangle you in that company which would destroy your soul—and
                    by repeated experiments it may appear that you cannot separate the one from the
                    other—or there may be an idiosyncrasy, a peculiarity in your constitution of
                    soul (as there is in the bodily constitution of many) by reason whereof that
                    employment is deadly to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> which another may safely
                    follow. So I am convinced, from many experiments, I could not study to any

                    experience shows, the more they are indulged, they increase the more. Whenever
                    therefore you expend anything to please your taste or other senses, you pay so
                    much for sensuality. When you lay out money to please your eye, you give so much
                    for an increase of curiosity, for a stronger attachment to these pleasures,
                    which perish in the using. While you are purchasing anything which men use to
                    applaud, you are purchasing more vanity. Had you not then enough of vanity,
                    sensuality, curiosity before? Was there need of any addition? And would you pay
                    for it, too? What manner of wisdom is this? Would not the literally throwing
                    your money into the sea be a less mischievous folly?</p>

                    yourself, in delicate food, in gay or costly apparel, in superfluities of any
                    kind? Why should you purchase for them more pride or lust, more vanity, or

                            (and to Wesley, the vice) of surplus accumulation. During the Gordon

                <p>3. The directions which God has given us touching the use of our worldly
                    substance may be comprised in the following particulars. If you desire to be a

                    has for the present lodged in your hands, but with the right of resuming
                    whenever it pleases him, first, provide things needful for yourself—food to eat,
                    raiment to put on, whatever nature moderately requires for preserving the body
                    in health and strength. Secondly, provide these for your wife, your children,
                    your servants, or any others who pertain to your household.<note place="foot"

                <p>4. If then a doubt should at any time arise in your mind concerning what you are
                    going to expend, either on yourself or any part of your family, you have an easy
                    way to remove it. Calmly and seriously inquire: (1). In expending this, am I
                    acting according to my character? Am I acting herein, not as a proprietor, but
                    as a steward of my Lord’s goods? (2). Am I doing this in obedience to his Word?
                    In what Scripture does he require me so to do? (3). Can I offer up this action,
                    this expense, as a sacrifice to God through Jesus Christ? (4). Have I reason to
                    believe that for this very work I shall have a reward at the resurrection of the
                    just? You will seldom need anything more to remove any doubt which arises on
                    this head; but by this fourfold consideration you will receive clear light as to
                    the way wherein you should go.</p>
                <p>5. If any doubt still remain, you may farther examine yourself by prayer
                    according to those heads of inquiry. Try whether you can say to the Searcher of
                    hearts, your conscience not condemning you: ‘Lord, thou seest I am going to
                    expend this sum on that food, apparel, furniture. And thou knowest I act herein
                    with a single eye as a steward of thy goods, expending this portion of them thus
                    in pursuance of the design thou hadst in entrusting me with them. Thou knowest I
                    do this in obedience to thy Word, as thou commandest, and because thou
                    commandest it. Let this, I beseech thee, be an holy sacrifice, acceptable
                    through Jesus Christ! And give me a witness in myself that for this labour of
                    love I shall have a recompense when thou rewardest every man according to his
                        works.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Matt. 16:27.</p></note> Now if your conscience bear you witness in the
                    Holy Ghost that this prayer is well-pleasing to God, then have you no reason to
                    doubt but that expense is right and good, and such as will never make you
                    ashamed.</p>
                <p>6. You see then what it is to ‘make [to] yourselves friends of the mammon of
                    unrighteousness’, and by what means you may procure ‘that when ye fail they may
                    receive you into the everlasting habitations’. You see the nature and extent of
                    truly Christian prudence so far as it relates to the use of that great
                    talent—money. <hi rend="italic">Gain all you can</hi>, without hurting either
                    yourself <hi n="02:279"/> or your neighbour, in soul or body, by applying hereto

                    dying, on sin or folly, whether for yourself or your children. And then, <hi
                        rend="italic">Give all you can</hi>, or in other words give all you have to
                    God. Do not stint yourself, like a Jew rather than a Christian, to this or that

                    unless we thus manage our Lord’s goods? We cannot, as not only the oracles of

                    should we confer any longer with flesh and blood, or men of the world? Our
