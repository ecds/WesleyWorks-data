                </head>
                <p>One of the prime targets in orthodox Christianity for the deists and other
                    apostles of enlightenment was the doctrine of original sin and total depravity.
                    It was a cherished conviction of theirs that men, once freed from their
                    superstitious errors, would recover their innate moral virtue: <hi rend="italic"
                        >viz.</hi>, the power to will the good and to do it (cf. Carl Becker, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers</hi>,
                    and Peter Gay, <hi rend="italic">The Enlightenment</hi>). The early Wesley was
                    never more than lightly touched by these attacks, save for a passing flirtation
                    with the newly fashionable cult of ‘the noble savage’. His view of mankind’s
                    primal ruin is delineated in his very early sermon on Gen. 1:27,<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text">No. 141, ‘The Image
                            of God’.</p></note> and this is presupposed elsewhere in his comments on
                    anthropology.</p>
                <p>But when a new optimism about man’s innate virtue, with a corresponding denial of
                    the Pauline and Augustinian notions of ‘the Fall’ and ‘original sin’, began to
                    be urged by professed Christians, Wesley was quick to sense a radical challenge
                    and to react on behalf of his people. To him, Article IX, ‘Of Original or Birth
                    Sin’, had always seemed unexceptionable: ‘…Man is very far gone from original
                    righteousness and is <hi rend="italic">of his own nature</hi> inclined to evil….
                    And this infection of nature doth remain…whereby the lust of the flesh, called
                    in Greek, φρόνημα σαρκός, is not subject to the Law of God.’</p>
                <p>The issue had come into focus for him in 1740, when Dr. John Taylor, an eminent
                    Dissenting minister in Norwich and a Hebrew scholar of growing fame, published
                    an influential treatise, <hi rend="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of Original
                        Sin: Proposed to Free and Candid Examination</hi> (cf. Alexander Gordon’s
                    comment on it in the <hi rend="italic">DNB</hi>: ‘The effect of [this book] in
                    combating the [orthodox] view of human nature was widespread and lasting. Its
                    influence in Scotland is signalised by Robert Bums, <hi rend="italic">Epistle to
                        John Goudie</hi>; in New England, according to Jonathan Edwards, “no one
                    book did so much towards rooting out the underlying ideas of the Westminster
                    Confession”.’). It had been quickly answered by two other Dissenting ministers,
                    Samuel Hebden, in an <pb n="02:171"/> appendix to <hi rend="italic">Man’s
                        Original Righteousness</hi> (1741), and in <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of
                        Original Sin…Vindicated</hi> (1741), and by Dr. David Jennings, <hi
                        rend="italic">A Vindication of the Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin</hi>
                    (1740). Wesley joined the fray in 1757 with the longest treatise that he ever
                    wrote (in four disjointed parts), <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of Original
                        Sin: According to Scripture, Reason, and Experience</hi> (pp. 522).<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p rend="footnote text">See <hi
                                rend="italic">Bibliog</hi>, No. 222; and Vol. 12 of this
                        edn.</p></note> Its first part is most nearly Wesley’s own answer to Taylor;
                    in the others he borrows heavily from Jennings, Hebden, Isaac Watts, Thomas
                    Boston, and others.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, he had been preaching on Gen. 6:5 (once in 1751; again in 1754 and
                    1757; and six times in 1758). Even so, he realized that oral preaching would not
                    suffice in the circumstances and that his full length volume was more than most
                    of his people would read. Accordingly, in 1759, he reformulated his own summary
                    of Part I of <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of Original Sin</hi> in sermon form
                    and published it separately in 1759. In 1760 he placed it at the head of the
                    added fourth volume 0f <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>. In 1766 he asked his
                    preachers in Conference, ‘Have the sermons on <hi rend="italic">Wandering
                        Thoughts</hi>, <hi rend="italic">In-being Sin</hi> [i.e., <hi rend="italic"
                        >this present sermon</hi>; cf. Samuel Johnson’s definition of ‘inbeing’],
                        <hi rend="italic">The Lord Our Righteousness</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">The
                        Scripture Way of Salvation</hi>, been carefully dispersed?’ and, to a
                    negative answer, directed them to ‘do it now’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3"
                        n="3"><p rend="footnote text"><hi rend="italic">Minutes</hi>, 1766, <hi
                                rend="italic">Q</hi>. [27].</p></note> In his mind, therefore, and
                    in the logic of his soteriology, this sermon was a major doctrinal statement in
                    which he sought to compound the Latin tradition of total depravity with the
                    Eastern Orthodox view of sin as disease (III.3) and of salvation as θεραπεία
                        ψυχῆς.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. the
                            origins of this idea of θεραπεία, in Robert E. Cushman, <hi

                    simple-minded references to Wesley as a Pelagian.</p>

                        great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart

                    which men have drawn in all ages! The writings of many of the ancients abound
                    with gay descriptions of the dignity of man; whom some of them paint as having
                    all virtue and happiness in his composition, or at least entirely in his power,
                    without being beholden to any other being; yea, as self-sufficient, able to live
                    on his own stock, and little inferior to God himself.<note place="foot"

                            vision of the nobility and transcendence of the human spirit had become
                            a Renaissance commonplace, as one may see in Thomas More’s <hi

                    little more than the dim light of reason, but many likewise of them that bear
                    the name of Christ, and to whom are entrusted the oracles of God,<note

                    concerning the nature of man, as if it were all innocence and perfection.
                    Accounts of this kind have particularly abounded in the present century; and
                    perhaps in no part of the world more than in our own country. Here not a few
                    persons of strong understanding, as well as extensive learning, have employed
                    their utmost abilities to show what they termed ‘the fair side of human nature’.
                    And it must be acknowledged that if their accounts of him be just, man is still
                    but ‘a little lower than the angels’, or (as the words may be more literally
                    rendered), ‘a little less than God’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"

                            translated ‘angels’ in the AV; elsewhere it is translated ‘God’ (and in
                            the Geneva Bible even Ps. 8:5 reads ‘God’). As noted above, the innate
                            virtue of man had been celebrated by the deists generally and by
                            Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, and Pope in particular. Bolingbroke, <hi
                                rend="italic">Works</hi> (1777), V. 351, had appealed to those who
                            sought enlightenment: ‘Let us be convinced, however, in opposition to
                            atheists and divines, that the general state of mankind in the present
                            scheme of providence is a state not only tolerable but happy.’ The same
                            point had been made in Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> (as in
                            III.232):</p>

                    think favourably of himself? Accordingly writers of this kind are almost
                    universally read, admired, applauded. And innumerable are the converts they have
                    made, not only in the gay but the learned world. So that it is now quite
                    unfashionable to talk otherwise, to say anything to the disparagement of human
                    nature; which is generally allowed, notwithstanding a few infirmities, to be
                    very innocent and wise and virtuous.</p>

                    before the flood. And we may fully depend on the account here given. For God saw
                    it, and he cannot be deceived. He ‘saw that the wickedness of man was great’.
                    Not of this or that man; not of a few men only; not barely of the greater part,

                    includes the whole human race, every partaker of human nature. And it is not
                    easy for us to compute their numbers, to tell how many thousands and millions
                    they were. The earth then retained much of its primeval beauty and original
                    fruitfulness. The face of the globe was not rent and torn as it is now; and
                    spring and summer went hand in hand. ’Tis therefore probable it afforded
                    sustenance for far more inhabitants than it is now capable of sustaining. And
                    these must be immensely multiplied while men begat sons and daughters for seven

                            rend="footnote text">There had been a lively debate about the
                            perfections of the antediluvian earth and the causes of the Flood; cf.
                            Chambers’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopaedia</hi> (‘Deluge’), for a summary
                            of popular wisdom on this point. Thomas Burnet, in his <hi rend="italic"
                                >Sacred Theory of the Earth</hi>, had speculated that the hitherto
                            smooth earth’s outer crust had cracked and had opened up the pent-up
                            floods beneath. This theory had then been attacked by Erasmus Warren and
                            John Keill, but William Whiston sought to advance the debate with his
                            own <hi rend="italic">New Theory of the Earth</hi> (read by Newton in
                            manuscript and praised by Locke). Whiston’s theory had included the
                            hypothesis of the earth’s collision with a huge comet.</p><p
                            rend="footnote text">For Wesley’s review of Burnet’s theory, cf. JWJ,
                            Jan. 17, 1770: ‘He is doubtless one of our first-rate writers, both as
                            to sense and style; his language is remarkably clear, unaffected,
                            nervous, and elegant. And as to his theory, none can deny that it is
                            ingenious, and consistent with itself. And it is highly probable (1)
                            that the earth arose out of the chaos in some such manner as he
                            describes; (2) that the antediluvian earth was without high or abrupt
                            mountains, and without sea, being one uniform crust, enclosing the great
                            abyss; (3) that the flood was caused by the breaking of this crust, and
                            its sinking into the abyss of waters; and (4) that the present state of
                            the earth, both internal and external, shows it to be the ruins of the
                            former earth.’</p></note> Yet among all this inconceivable number <hi

                    exception from the universal wickedness, which by the just judgment of God in a

                    in the same guilt, as they were in the same punishment.</p>
                <p n="2">2. ‘God saw all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart’—of his soul,
                    his inward man, the spirit within him, the <pb n="02:175"/>principle of all his
                    inward and outward motions. He ‘saw all the imaginations’. It is not possible to
                    find a word of a more extensive signification. It includes whatever is formed,
                    made, fabricated within; all that is or passes in the soul: every inclination,
                    affection, passion, appetite; every temper, design, thought. It must of
                    consequence include every word and action, as naturally flowing from the
                    fountains, and being either good or evil according to the fountain from which
                    they severally flow.</p>
                <p n="3">3. Now God ‘saw that all’ this, the whole thereof, ‘was evil’, contrary to
                    moral rectitude; contrary to the nature of God, which necessarily includes all
                    good; contrary to the divine will, the eternal standard of good and evil;
                    contrary to the pure, holy image of God, wherein man was originally created, and
                    wherein he stood when God, surveying the works of his hands, saw them all to be
                    ‘very good’;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22" n="22"><p rend="footnote text"

                    cannot indeed be denied but many of them, perhaps all, had good motions put into
                    their hearts. For the spirit of God did then also ‘strive with man’,<note

                    a certain issue made the following experiment: he ordered two infants, as soon
                    as they were born, to be conveyed to a place prepared for them, where they were
                    brought up without any instruction at all, and without ever hearing an human
                    voice. And what was the event? Why, that when they were at length brought out of
                    their confinement, they spake no language at all, they uttered inarticulate
                    sounds, like those of other animals.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p

                            original point to his own purposes. The ancient king was Psammetichus of
                            Egypt, and the reported experiment was much as Wesley has it. But, ‘when
                            the shepherd [caretaker]…opened the door…both the children ran to him
                            stretching out their hands and calling, “Bekos”…. On command he brought
                            the children into the king’s presence. Psammetichus heard them himself
                            and inquired to what language this word “Bekos” might belong. He was
                            told it was a Phrygian word signifying “bread” [or food]. Reasoning from
                            this fact, the Egyptians confessed that the Phrygians were older [in
                            their culture] than they.’</p></note> Were <hi n="02:178"/> two infants
                    in like manner to be brought up from the womb without being instructed in any
                    religion, there is little room to doubt but (unless the grace of God interposed)
                    the event would be just the same. They would have no religion at all: they would
                    know no more of God than the beasts of the field, than the ‘wild ass’s

                    him. But the fact is too plain to be denied. No man loves God by nature, no more
                    than he does a stone, or the earth he treads upon. What we love, we delight in:
                    but no man has naturally any delight in God. In our natural state we cannot
                    conceive how anyone should delight in him. We take no pleasure in him at all; he
                    is utterly tasteless to us. To love God! It is far above, out of our sight. We

                    Therefore all pride is idolatry; it is ascribing to ourselves what is due to God

                    born without it? But hereby we rob God of his unalienable right, and

                <p n="1">III. 1. I proceed to draw a few inferences from what has been said. And,
                    first, from hence we may learn one grand, fundamental difference between
                    Christianity, considered as a system of doctrines, and the most refined
                    heathenism. Many of the ancient <pb n="02:183"/>heathens have largely described
                    the vices of particular men. They have spoken much against their covetousness or
                    cruelty, their luxury or prodigality. Some have dared to say that ‘no man is
                    born without vices of one kind or another.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn62"

                            (II.vi.1, Vol. 12 in this edn.), where the same passage is quoted, along
                            with supporting testimony from Horace and Seneca.</p></note> But still,
                    as none of them were apprised of the fall of man, so none of them knew his total
                    corruption. They knew not that all men were empty of all good, and filled with
                    all manner of evil. They were wholly ignorant of the entire depravation of the
                    whole human nature, of every man born into the world, in every faculty of his
                    soul, not so much by those particular vices which reign in particular persons as
                    by the general flood of atheism and idolatry, of pride, self-will, and love of
                    the world. This, therefore, is the first, grand, distinguishing point between
                    heathenism and Christianity. The one acknowledges that many men are infected
                    with many vices, and even born with a proneness to them; but supposes withal
                    that in some the natural good much overbalances the evil. The other declares
                    that all men are ‘conceived in sin’, and ‘shapen in wickedness’;<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn63" n="63"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Ps. 51:5
                            (BCP).</p></note> that hence there is in every man a ‘carnal mind which
                    is enmity against God, which is not, cannot be, subject to his law’,<note
                        place="foot" xml:id="ftn64" n="64"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Rom.

                    ‘all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart is evil’, ‘<hi rend="italic"

                <p n="2">2. Hence we may, secondly, learn that all who deny this—call it ‘original
                    sin’ or by any other title—are but heathens still in the fundamental point which
                    differences heathenism from Christianity. They may indeed allow that men have
                    many vices; that some are born with us; and that consequently we are not born
                    altogether so wise or so virtuous as we should be; there being few that will
                    roundly affirm we are born with as much propensity to good as to evil, and that
                    every man is by nature as virtuous and wise as Adam was at his creation. But

                    what is in man gives a far different account both of nature and grace, of our
                    fall and our recovery. Ye know that the great end of religion is to renew our
                    hearts in the image of God, to repair that total loss of righteousness and true
                    holiness which we sustained by the sin of our first parent.<note place="foot"

                            image of God is the axial theme of Wesley’s soteriology; cf. Nos. 12,

                    all that stops short of this, the renewal of our soul in the image of God, after
                    the likeness of him that created it, is no other than a poor farce and a mere
                    mockery of God, to the destruction of our own soul. O beware of all those
                    teachers of lies who would palm this upon you for Christianity! Regard them not,
