                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 18-19]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>With <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, I, Wesley could suppose that he had established
                    the basis for his doctrine of justification by faith alone, understood as the
                    threshold of true religion. Taking this then as given—with occasioned short
                    reaffirmations, as in I.3 below—he was free to devote the remainder of his
                    collection to the problems of the ongoing Christian life, from its beginnings in
                    saving faith to its fullness in perfect love. This is evident in the ordering of
                    the sermons; they are out of their chronological sequence, but they have their
                    own logic. Thus, after ‘The Circumcision of the Heart’ Wesley adds a pair of
                    sermons about <hi rend="italic">regeneration</hi>, understood as that act of
                    grace concurrent with justification but not at all identical to it—a ‘vast
                    inward change’ that opens up the lifelong quest for holiness.</p>
                <p>In the first of the pair (as also later in No. 45, ‘The New Birth’) Wesley
                    wrestles with an unresolved dilemma in his beliefs and teachings. He had been
                    brought up to take <hi rend="italic">baptismal</hi> regeneration for granted, as
                    in the office for Baptism in the BCP, in Art. XXVII (‘Of Baptism’), and in his
                    father’s ‘Of Baptism’ in <hi rend="italic">The Pious Communicant Rightly
                        Prepared</hi> (1700), which he would thereafter abridge and publish in his
                    own name (1758). John seems always to have believed that <hi rend="italic">something</hi> ‘happens’ in baptism (and in infant baptism at that) that
                    validates its propriety and necessity as the sacrament of Christian initiation;
                    he rejected the logic of ‘believer’s baptism’ which always presupposes
                    ‘conversion’ before baptism.</p>
                <p>Even so, his own experience and the dramatic conversions in the Revival had
                    forced on him a recognition of yet another sort of regeneration, more decisive
                    and subjective, more nearly correlated with justification and assurance than
                    with water baptism. Thus, somewhat as he had explained ‘the circumcision of the
                    heart’ as a personal transformation following baptism, so now, in ‘The Marks of
                    the New Birth’ and ‘The Great Privilege of those that are Born of God’ (and
                    again, later, in No. 45, ‘The New Birth’), he was in search of a doctrine of
                    regeneration that would take seriously the realities of evangelical <pb n="416"/>conversions and yet not repudiate his own sacramental traditions. Whether he
                    ever fully succeeded is an open question; it is undeniable that the doctrine of
                    infant baptism as an objective divine action has never had more than a tenuous
                    place in the Methodist tradition. (For a fuller probing of the theological
                    problem of baptism and regeneration, cf. Robert E. Cushman, ‘Baptism and the
                    Family of God’, in Dow Kirkpatrick, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of the
                        Church</hi> [New York, Abingdon, 1964], pp. 79-102.)</p>
                <p>All this, then, was part of the context of Wesley’s direct concern in these two
                    sermons, the special ‘powers’ (or ‘privileges’, as Wesley prefers to translate
                    ἐξουσία in John 1:12) of justified and regenerated Christians. To this end, he
                    borrows from the analogy of latency from physical birth to point to the latent
                    powers in the human spirit when enlivened by its Creator Spirit (cf. the ‘title’
                    of the Holy Spirit in the Latin text of the Nicene Creed: <hi rend="italic">Vivificator</hi>). Just as the ‘circumcision of the heart’ had involved
                    ‘humility, faith, hope, and charity’, so also ‘the [distinctive] marks of the
                    New Birth’ are ‘faith, hope, and love’.</p>
                <p>In expounding this Christian commonplace, however, Wesley comes, under the
                    heading of ‘faith’, to his crucial assertion that the regenerate believer
                    receives real power (or ‘the privilege’) <hi rend="italic">not to commit
                        sin</hi>, and so to enjoy unanxious peace in heart and mind. Here Wesley
                    comes as close as he ever will to an unnuanced notion of Christian existence as
                    sinless; he even goes on to denounce those who try to qualify this with the more
                    modest claim that the regenerate ‘do not commit sin <hi rend="italic">habitually</hi>’ (I.5). He must have realized, however, that he had laid
                    himself open to misinterpretation, and so he proceeded to add ‘The Great
                    Privilege of those that are Born of God’, and with it a more careful distinction
                    between ‘sin properly so called’ and other shortfallings, i.e., between
                    voluntary and involuntary sins, where ‘voluntary’ sounds suspiciously like
                    ‘habitual’. After that he can develop his metaphor of a spiritual sensorium and
                    his concept of human ‘re-actions’ to divine ‘actions’. This would suggest that
                    the two sermons are better read as a pair than apart.</p>
                <p>Both seem to have been written versions of Wesley’s oral preaching, reaching back
                    to the beginnings of the Revival. It is recorded that he had preached from John
                    3:8 as early as <date when="1739-06-10">June 10, 1739</date>, and frequently
                    thereafter (fourteen times in all until December 1757). His first recorded
                    sermon from 1 John 3:9 comes on <date when="1739-09-23">September 23,
                        1739</date>; a second comes on <date when="1740-01-17">January 17,
                        1740</date>; its last usage as a sermon text seems to have been in November
                    1756. Even in 1748, however, with these twin sermons, Wesley had laid out one of
                    the undergirding premises of his unfolding vision of Christian existence.</p>

                <p n="1">1. It has been frequently supposed that the being born of God was all one
                    with the being justified; that the new birth and justification were only
                    different expressions denoting the same thing:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                        <p rend="footnote text">As in William Law, <hi rend="italic">The

                            (1739), §§22-31 (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, V.155-66). But see also,
                            even if in a differently nuanced statement, Arthur Bedford’s sermon, <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of Justification by Faith</hi> (1741).
                            The longer tradition to which Wesley here refers goes back to the
                            Reformation, as in Quenstedt, <hi rend="italic">Theologia
                                Didactico-Polemica</hi>, where, in III.477, it is affirmed that
                            regeneration may be ‘taken <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi> for the
                            remission of sins or justification (Gal. 3:11), in which sense the
                            Formula of Concord states it to be very frequently used in the <hi rend="italic">Apology of the Augsburg Confession</hi>; or for
                            renovation as it shows it to be frequently used by Luther.’ In the
                            Reformed tradition regeneration was more closely related to ‘<hi rend="italic">calling</hi>’ (the <hi rend="italic">applicatio
                                salutis</hi>) and thus rooted in the doctrine of election (<hi rend="italic">vocatio</hi>). See Heppe, <hi rend="italic">Reformed
                                Dogmatics</hi>, ch. xx, pp. 510-30.</p>
                        <p rend="footnote text">See
                            also No. 1, <hi rend="italic">Salvation by Faith</hi>, II.7:

                                <hi rend="italic">followed by</hi> the new birth, which is its
                            fullness, cf. the later sermon ‘On Patience’ (No. 83), §9. This
                            correlation (and differentiation) between justification and regeneration
                            was crucial for Wesley’s distinction between God’s action in pardoning
                            the repentant and the human effect of this action (‘regeneration’, ‘new
                            birth’, ‘conversion’). Cf. No. 14, <hi rend="italic">The Repentance of
                                Believers</hi>, III.2 and n.</p>

                    hand that whoever is justified is also born of God, and on the other that
                    whoever is born of God is also justified; yea, that both these gifts of God are
                    given to every believer in one and the same moment. In one point of time his
                    sins are blotted out and he is born of God.</p>
                <p n="2">2. But though it be allowed that justification and the new birth are in
                    point of time inseparable from each other, yet are they easily distinguished as
                    being not the same, but things of a widely different nature. Justification
                    implies only a relative, the new birth a real, change.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                        <p rend="footnote text">Cf. No. 43, <hi rend="italic">The Scripture Way of Salvation</hi>, I.4. In both places, and
                            generally, Wesley sees justification as a change in the relationship
                            between God and the believer, whereas regeneration is a ‘<hi rend="italic">real change</hi>’ of heart. Thus it is the threshold
                            of the process of holy living, logically consequent upon justification
                            and the beginning of sanctification. The two, then, are concurrent and
                            yet decisively different.</p>
                    </note> God in justifying us does something
                        <hi rend="italic">for</hi> us: in <pb n="432"/>begetting us again he does
                    the work <hi rend="italic">in</hi> us. The former changes our outward relation
                    to God, so that of enemies we become children; by the latter our inmost souls
                    are changed, so that of sinners we become saints. The one restores us to the
                    favour, the other to the image of God. The one is the taking away the guilt, the
                    other the taking away the power, of sin. So that although they are joined
                    together in point of time, yet are they of wholly distinct natures.</p>
                <p n="3">3. The not discerning this, the not observing the wide difference there is
                    between being justified and being born again, has occasioned exceeding great
                    confusion of thought in many who have treated on this subject; particularly when
                    they have attempted to explain this great privilege of the children of God, to
                    show how ‘whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">

                    consider what is the proper meaning of that expression, ‘whosoever is born of

                    baptized, or any outward change whatever; but a vast inward change; a change
                    wrought in the soul by the operation of the Holy Ghost, a change in the whole

                <p n="1">III. 1. From the preceding considerations we may learn, first, to give a
                    clear and incontestable answer to a question which has frequently perplexed many
                    who were sincere of heart. Does sin precede or follow the loss of faith? Does a
                    child of God first commit sin, and thereby lose his faith? Or does he lose his
                    faith first, before he can commit sin?</p>
                <p>I answer: some sin, of omission at least, must necessarily precede the loss of
                    faith—some inward sin. But the loss of faith must precede the committing outward
                        sin.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn60" n="60">
                        <p rend="footnote text">This
                            distinction between ‘omission’ and ‘commission’ is also essential to the

                            believers’. But the line between involuntary and voluntary omissions is
                            easy to slide across, in one direction or the other, and this never
                            ceased to be a problem for Wesley. Cf. No. 14, <hi rend="italic">The

                    the soul of a believer is, wherein it properly consists, and what is immediately
                    and necessarily implied therein. It immediately and necessarily implies the
                    continual inspiration of God’s Holy Spirit: God’s breathing into the soul, and
                    the soul’s breathing back what it first receives from God; a continual action of
                    God upon the soul, and re-action of the soul upon God; an unceasing presence of
                    God, the loving, pardoning God, manifested to the heart, and perceived by faith;
                    and an unceasing return of love, praise, and prayer, offering up all the
                    thoughts of our hearts, all the words of our tongues, all the works of our
                    hands, all our body, soul, and spirit, to be an holy sacrifice, acceptable unto
                        God<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn66" n="66">

                <p n="3">3. And hence we may, thirdly, infer the absolute necessity of this
                    re-action of the soul (whatsoever it be called) in order to the continuance of
                    the divine life therein. For it plainly appears God does not continue to act
                    upon the soul unless the soul re-acts upon God. He prevents us indeed with the
                    blessings of his goodness. He first loves us, and manifests himself unto us.
