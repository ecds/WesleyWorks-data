                <head><hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment</hi></head>
                <p>In the conclusion of <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi> (II.28), Wesley
                    had boldly stated ‘that Christians are saved in this world from all sin’, that
                    ‘they are now in such a sense perfect as not to commit sin and to be freed from
                    evil thoughts and evil tempers.’ Taken literally, this flew in the face of
                    obvious experience and of Wesley’s own previous qualifications. And, of course,
                    it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> taken literally, thus provoking easy
                    misinterpretations which could not then be easily refuted. Wesley was more
                    willing to qualify such overstatements than to acknowledge them as such, or to
                    seem to contradict himself. Thus, at least as early as March 1757, he had begun
                    to explain that ‘wandering thoughts’, <hi rend="italic">properly
                    understood</hi>, were not to be included in that class of sins that are properly
                    so <hi rend="italic">called</hi>. He did this again on November 30, 1760 (in
                    Spitalfields) and January 1, 1761 (at the West Street Chapel). Professor Frank
                    Baker has reviewed the complicated bibliographic evidence and finds no support
                    for Sugden’s conjecture of a published version of <hi rend="italic">Wandering
                        Thoughts</hi> as early as 1761; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> comes a year
                    later, printed in Bristol by Elizabeth Farley. It was also reprinted, line for
                    line, in York in 1763. Also in 1763, a second edition of the separate sermon was
                    printed (also in Bristol) by William Pine, who was printing an undated second
                    edition of <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, III, with <hi rend="italic">Wandering
                        Thoughts</hi> quietly inserted <hi rend="italic">after Christian
                        Perfection</hi>, as an obvious addendum, and before ‘Satan’s Devices’ (the
                    original sequel to <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi> in 1750). For
                    further details of this publishing history, along with a list of variant
                    readings in the twelve extant editions from Wesley’s lifetime, see Appendix,
                    Vol. 4.</p>
                <p>What this means, however, is that the prime function of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Wandering Thoughts</hi> was to deny what Wesley had never really intended
                    to affirm, and to do this with a new sermon that was, in effect, an extended
                    annotation of II.28 of <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi>. It also
                    means that <hi rend="italic">Wandering Thoughts</hi> was <hi rend="italic"
                        >probably</hi> contained in that edition of ‘the four volumes of sermons’
                    stipulated in the Model Deed of 1763 as a doctrinal standard for Methodist
                    trustees and preachers. In any case the <pb n="02:126"/>idea was clearly in
                    Wesley’s mind. The question of the sermon as ‘a standard’ is far less important,
                    however, than its link with <hi rend="italic">On Sin in Believers</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">The Repentance of Believers</hi> as a trio of needed
                    qualifiers of <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi>—of both the general
                    idea and of the sermon of 1741.</p>

            <epigraph>
                <p>2 Corinthians 10:4</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
                        Christ.</hi></p>
            </epigraph>
            <div type="introduction">
                <p n="1">1. But will God so ‘bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of
                    Christ’ that no wandering thought will find a place in the mind, even while we
                    remain in the body? So some have vehemently maintained; yea, have affirmed that
                    none are perfected in love unless they are so far perfected in understanding
                    that all wandering thoughts are done away; unless not only every affection and
                    temper be holy, and just, and good,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p
                            rend="footnote text">See Rom. 7:12.</p></note> but every individual
                    thought which arises in the mind be wise and regular.</p>
                <p n="2">2. This is a question of no small importance. For how many of those who
                    fear God, yea, and love him, perhaps with all their heart, have been greatly
                    distressed on this account! How many, by not understanding it right, have not
                    only been distressed, but greatly hurt in their souls! Cast into unprofitable,
                    yea, mischievous reasonings, such as slackened their motion towards God, and
                    weakened them in running the race set before them.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p rend="footnote text">See Heb. 12:1.</p></note> Nay,
                    many, through misapprehensions of this very thing, have cast away the precious
                    gift of God. They have been induced first to doubt of, and then to deny, the
                    work God had wrought in their souls; and hereby have grieved the Spirit of
                        God,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text">See Eph.
                            4:30.</p></note> till he withdrew and left them in utter darkness.</p>
                <p n="3">3. How is it, then, that amidst the abundance of books which have been
                    lately published almost on all subjects, we should have <pb n="02:127"/>none
                    upon ‘wandering thoughts’?<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p
                            rend="footnote text">This sense of ‘wandering thoughts’ as meaning
                            ‘random’ or ‘undirected by reason’ is cited by <hi rend="italic"
                                >OED</hi> from as early as the fifteenth century.</p></note> At
                    least none that will at all satisfy a calm and serious mind? In order to do this
                    in some degree I purpose to inquire,</p>
                <p>I. What are the several sorts of wandering thoughts?</p>
                <p>II. What are the general occasions of them?</p>
                <p>IIΙ. Which of them are sinful, and which not?</p>
                <p>IV. Which of them we may expect and pray to be delivered from?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section" n="1">
                <p n="1">I. 1. I purpose to inquire, first, What are the several sorts of wandering
                    thoughts? The particular sorts are innumerable; but in general they are of two
                    sorts—thoughts that wander from God, and thoughts that wander from the
                    particular point we have in hand.</p>
                <p n="2">2. With regard to the former, all our thoughts are naturally of this kind.
                    For they are continually wandering from God: we think nothing about him. God is
                    not in all our thoughts: we are one and all, as the Apostle observes, ‘without
                    God in the world’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p rend="footnote text"
                            >Eph. 2:12.</p></note> We think of what we love; but we do not love God;
                    therefore we think not of him. Or if we are now and then constrained to think of
                    him for a time, yet as we have no pleasure therein, nay, rather, as these
                    thoughts are not only insipid, but distasteful and irksome to us, we drive them
                    out as soon as we can, and return to what we love to think of. So that the world
                    and the things of the world—what we shall eat, what we shall drink, what we
                    shall put on,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Matt. 6:25.</p></note> what we shall see, what we shall hear, what we
                    shall gain, how we shall please our senses or our imagination—takes up all our
                    time, and engrosses all our thoughts. So long therefore as we love the world,
                    that is, so long as we are in our natural state, all our thoughts from morning
                    to evening, and from evening to morning, are no other than wandering
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p n="3">3. But many times we are not only ‘without God in the world’, but also
                    ‘fighting against him’,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Cf. Acts 5:39.</p></note> as there is in every man
                    by nature ‘a carnal mind which is enmity against God’.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn8" n="8"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Rom. 8:7.</p></note> No
                    wonder, therefore, that men abound with <hi rend="italic">unbelieving</hi>
                    thoughts, either saying in their hearts, There is no God,<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn9" n="9"><p rend="footnote text">Ps. 14:1.</p></note> or
                    questioning, if not <pb n="02:128"/>denying, his power or wisdom, his mercy, or
                    justice, or holiness. No wonder that they so often doubt of his providence, at
                    least of its extending to all events; or that, even though they allow it, they
                    still entertain <hi rend="italic">murmuring</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >repining</hi> thoughts. Nearly related to these, and frequently connected
                    with them, are <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vain</hi>
                        imaginations.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn10" n="10"><p
                            rend="footnote text">A conflation of Luke 1:51 and Rom. 1:21.</p></note>
                    Again: sometimes they are taken up with <hi rend="italic">angry</hi>, <hi
                        rend="italic">malicious</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">revengeful</hi> thoughts;
                    at other times with airy scenes of pleasure, whether of sense or imagination;
                    whereby the earthy sensual mind becomes more <hi rend="italic">earthy</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">sensual</hi> still. Now by all these they make flat war
                    with God; these are wandering thoughts of the highest kind.</p>
                <p n="4">4. Widely different from these are the other sort of wandering thoughts, in
                    which the heart does not wander from God, but the understanding wanders from the
                    particular point it had then in view. For instance: I sit down to consider those
                    words in the verse preceding the text, ‘The weapons of our warfare are not
                    carnal, but mighty through God.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p
                            rend="footnote text">2 Cor. 10:4.</p></note> I think, ‘This ought to be
                    the case with all that are called Christians. But how far is it otherwise! Look
                    round into almost every part of what is termed the Christian world! What manner
                    of weapons are these using? In what kind of warfare are they engaged,</p>

                            called ‘The Seven Years’ War’ (1756-63); cf. Basil Williams, <hi
                                rend="italic">The Whig Supremacy, 1714-1760</hi>, pp. 330-50. It was
                            a sort of world war involving most of Europe, together with India and
                            Canada.</p></note>

                    or heathens which is not found among Christians also?’ And thus my mind runs
                    off, before I am aware, from one circumstance to another. Now all these are in
                    some sense wandering thoughts; for although they do not wander from God, much
                    less fight against him, yet they do wander from the particular point I had in

                        n="14"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Ps. 10:4.</p></note> in any of the
                    thoughts, of a natural man? For a plain reason: be he rich or poor, learned or
                    unlearned, he is an atheist (though not vulgarly so called)—he neither knows nor
                    loves God. Why are his thoughts continually wandering after the world? Because
                    he is an idolater. He does not indeed worship an image, or bow down to the stock
                    of a tree; yet is he sunk into equally damnable idolatry: he loves, that is,
                    worships the world. He seeks happiness in the things that are seen, in the
                    pleasures that perish in the using. Why is it that his thoughts are perpetually
                    wandering from the very end of his being, the knowledge of God in Christ?
                    Because he is an unbeliever; because he has no faith, or at least no more than a
                        devil.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p rend="footnote text">See

                    nature. And so does every sinful temper of which the human kind is capable. The
                    particulars it is hardly possible, nor is it needful, to enumerate. It suffices
                    to observe that as many evil tempers<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn16" n="16"><p

                    diseased body! Let but the blood move irregularly in the brain, and all regular
                    thinking is at an end. Raging madness ensues, and then farewell to all evenness
                    of thought. Yea, let only the spirits be hurried or agitated to a certain
                    degree, and a temporary madness, a delirium, prevents all settled thought. And

                    various impulse[s] of outward objects. Whatever strikes upon the organ of sense,
                    the eye or ear, will raise a perception in the mind. And accordingly, whatever
                    we see or hear will break in upon our former train of thought. Every man,
                    therefore, that does anything in our sight, or speaks anything in our hearing,
                    occasions our mind to wander more or less from the point it was thinking of

                    permits, interrupt our thoughts, particularly when they are engaged on the best
                    subjects. Nor is this at all strange: they well understand the very springs of

                    more are all those which are contrary to God, which imply opposition or enmity

                    will not have thee to rule over us;’ all unbelieving thoughts, whether with
                    regard to his being, his attributes, or his providence. I mean his particular
                    providence over all things as well as all persons in the universe: that without
                    which ‘not a sparrow falls to the ground’, by which ‘the hairs of our head are

                    or confirm and increase these or any other unholy temper, passion, or affection.
                    For not only whatever flows from evil is evil, but also whatever leads to it;
                    whatever tends to alienate the soul from God, and to make or keep it ‘earthly,

                    constitution or from some accidental weakness or distemper they are as innocent
                    as it is to have a weak constitution or a distempered body. And surely no one
                    doubts but a bad state of nerves, a fever of any kind, and either a transient or
                    a lasting delirium, may consist with perfect innocence. And if they should arise
                    in a soul which is united to a healthful body, either from the natural union

                <p n="6">6. If our thoughts wander from the point we had in view by means of other
                    men variously affecting our senses, they are equally innocent still: for it is
                    no more a sin to understand what I see and hear, and in many cases cannot help
                    seeing, hearing, and understanding, than it is to have eyes and ears. ‘But if

                    or outwardly, our Lord doubtless understood what he said. He had therefore a

                    was not. ‘In him was no sin,’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn37" n="37"><p

                    have affirmed, thereby grieving whom the Lord had not grieved) are inconsistent
                    with perfect love. Indeed if they were, then not only sharp pain, but sleep
                    itself would be inconsistent with it. Sharp pain; for whenever this supervenes,
                    whatever we were before thinking of, it will interrupt our thinking, and of
                    course draw our thoughts into another channel. Yea, and sleep itself, as it is a
                    state of insensibility and stupidity; and such as is generally mixed with
                    thoughts wandering over the earth, loose, wild, and incoherent.<note

                <p n="1">IV. 1. From what has been observed it is easy to give a clear answer to the
                    last question—what kind of wandering thoughts we may expect and pray to be
                    delivered from.</p>
                <p>From the former sort of wandering thoughts, those wherein the heart wanders from
                    God; from all that are contrary to his will, <pb n="02:135"/>or that leave us
                    without God in the world, everyone that is perfected in love is unquestionably
                        delivered.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p rend="footnote text"
                            >No. 40, <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi>, II.28, more
                            amplified than qualified—and reasserted.</p></note> This deliverance
                    therefore we may expect; this we may, we ought to pray for. Wandering thoughts
                    of this kind imply unbelief, if not enmity against God. But both of these he
                    will destroy, will bring utterly to an end. And, indeed, from all sinful
                    wandering thoughts we shall be absolutely delivered. All that are perfected in
                    love are delivered from these; else they were not saved from sin. Men and devils
                    will tempt them all manner of ways; but they cannot prevail over them.</p>
                <p n="2">2. With regard to the latter sort of wandering thoughts the case is widely
                    different. Till the cause is removed we cannot in reason expect the effect
                    should cease. But the causes or occasions of these will remain as long as we
                    remain in the body. So long therefore we have all reason to believe the effects
                    will remain also.</p>
                <p n="3">3. To be more particular. Suppose a soul, however holy, to dwell in a
                    distempered body; suppose the brain be so throughly disordered as that raging
                    madness follows; will not all the thoughts be wild and unconnected, as long as
                    that disorder continues? Suppose a fever occasions that temporary madness which
                    we term a delirium, can there be any just connection of thought till that
                    delirium is removed? Yea, suppose what is called a nervous disorder to rise to
                    so high a degree as occasions at least a partial madness, will there not be a
                    thousand wandering thoughts? And must not these irregular thoughts continue as
                    long as the disorder which occasions them?</p>
                <p n="4">4. Will not the case be the same with regard to those thoughts that
                    necessarily arise from violent pain? They will more or less continue while that
                    pain continues, by the inviolable order of nature. This order likewise will
                    obtain where the thoughts are disturbed, broken, or interrupted, by any defect
                    of the apprehension, judgment, or imagination, flowing from the natural
                    constitution of the body. And how many interruptions may spring from the
                    unaccountable and involuntary associations of our ideas! Now all these are
                    directly or indirectly caused by the corruptible body pressing down the
                        mind.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Wisd. 9:15. See above, II.3 and n.</p></note> Nor therefore can we
                    expect them to be removed till ‘this corruptible shall put on
                        incorruption.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn41" n="41"><p
                            rend="footnote text">1 Cor. 15:54.</p></note></p>
                <p n="5"><pb n="02:136"/>5. And then only, when we lie down in the dust, shall we be
                    delivered from those wandering thoughts which are occasioned by what we see and
                    hear among those by whom we are now surrounded. To avoid these we must go out of
                    the world.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn42" n="42"><p rend="footnote text">See 1
                            Cor. 5:10.</p></note> For as long as we remain therein, as long as there
                    are men and women round about us, and we have eyes to see and ears to hear,<note

                    affect our mind, and will more or less break in upon and interrupt our preceding
                    thoughts.</p>
                <p n="6">6. And as long as evil spirits roam to and fro in a miserable, disordered
                    world, so long they will assault (whether they can prevail or no) every
                    inhabitant of flesh and blood. They will trouble even those whom they cannot
                    destroy: they will attack, if they cannot conquer. And from these attacks of our
                    restless, unwearied enemies, we must not look for an entire deliverance till we
                    are lodged ‘where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at
                        rest’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44"><p rend="footnote text">Cf.

                <p n="7">7. To sum up the whole: to expect deliverance from those wandering thoughts
                    which are occasioned by evil spirits is to expect that the devil should die or
                    fall asleep; or at least should no more go about as a roaring lion.<note

                    intercourse with them; or that having eyes we should not see, neither hear with
                    our ears, but be as senseless as stocks or stones. And to pray for deliverance
                    from those which are occasioned by the body is in effect to pray that we may
                    leave the body. Otherwise it is praying for impossibilities and absurdities;
                    praying that God would reconcile contradictions by continuing our union with a
                    corruptible body without the natural, necessary consequences of that union. It
                    is as if we should pray to be angels and men, mortal and immortal, at the same
                    time. Nay, but when that which is immortal is come, mortality is done away.<note
