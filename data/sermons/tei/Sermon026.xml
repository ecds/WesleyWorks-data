                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 21-33]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>The unifying theme of these next thirteen ‘discourses’ on the Sermon on the
                    Mount, with all their variations and nuancings, is the Christian life understood
                    as the fruit of justifying faith. But given such faith, what follows? Wesley’s
                    answer is given in this extended exposition of the Christian life based on the
                        <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of evangelical ethics, ‘The Sermon on
                    the Mount’ (i.e., Matthew 5-7). Since Tyndale, this ‘sermon’ had been understood
                    as ‘the epitome of God’s laws and promises’ for Christian believers; cf.
                    Clebsch, <hi rend="italic">England’s Earliest Protestants</hi>, p. 184; see also
                    William Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Expository Notes…on the New Testament</hi>
                    (eleven editions between 1700 and 1739), Preface to chapter 5: ‘Christ’s famous
                    Sermon on the Mount comprehends the sum and substance of both the Old and New
                    Testaments.’</p>
                <p>Taken together, the following sermons are not a thirteen-part essay, tightly
                    organized and argued. Instead, they are separate sermons, drawn from materials
                    running back to 1725, arranged in a triadic pattern that seems to have been
                    original with Wesley. Each is a discourse in its own right; yet the series is
                    designed so that each appears as a part of a whole. This means that the sermons
                    may be read singly or together, but with an eye on their shared aim: ‘to assert
                    and prove every branch of <hi rend="italic">gospel obedience</hi> as
                    indispensably necessary to eternal salvation’; cf. Wesley’s open letter (Nov.
                    17, 1759) to John Downes in reply to the latter’s abusive <hi rend="italic">Methodism Examined and Exposed</hi> (1759).</p>
                <p>Many of the great and near-great commentators of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries had devoted their talents to the interpretation of Matthew 5-7 as the
                    principal summary of Christian ethics, or, in Henry Hammond’s phrase, as ‘an
                    abstract of Christian philosophy’; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Catechism</hi> (1st edn., <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1644), II.1, in the <hi rend="italic">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</hi> (1847), p. 83. Chief
                    among these earlier works, in the order of their influences upon Wesley’s
                    thought, were Bishop Offspring Blackall, ‘Eighty-Seven Practical Discourses Upon
                    Our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.1-561;
                    II.609-939; <pb n="467"/>John Norris, <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Discourses</hi>; the American, James Blair, <hi rend="italic">Our Saviour’s
                        Divine Sermon on the Mount in IV Volumes</hi> (1722; 2nd edn., 1740, with a
                    preface by Daniel Waterland); John Cardinal Bona, <hi rend="italic">Guide to
                        Eternity…</hi> (six editions in English between 1672 and 1712); and Henry
                    Hammond, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Echoes of all these are scattered along
                    the way, together with lesser borrowings from Bengel, Poole, and Henry. This
                    makes it all the more remarkable that Wesley came up with a model of his own,
                    both inform and substance. This series thus reminds us, yet again, of Wesley’s
                    ready appeal to tradition—even while he maintains his own originality and
                    independence.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Ingham records in his Journal that ‘during the voyage [to Georgia]
                    Wesley went over our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’ with the ship’s company
                    aboard the <hi rend="italic">Simmonds</hi>. There are also other records of his
                    preaching, very early on, from one or another text in Matthew 5-7. For example,
                    his second sermon was preached at Binsey (near Oxford), November 21, 1725, on
                    Matt. 6:33. A first draft of the sermon which appears here as ‘Discourse VIII’
                    seems to have been written out in 1736. Later, it was the example of the Sermon
                    on the Mount that encouraged Wesley to break out of his High Church prejudices
                    in Bristol, April 1, 1739: ‘In the evening (Mr. Whitefield being gone) I begun
                    expounding our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount (one pretty remarkable precedent of
                        <hi rend="italic">field preaching</hi>, though I suppose <hi rend="italic">there were churches</hi> at that time also) to a little society which was
                    accustomed to meet once or twice a week in Nicholas Street;’ cf. <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries for this whole story of the unplanned
                    outbreak of the Wesleyan Revival.</p>
                <p>The records show that, between 1739 and 1746, Wesley preached more than one
                    hundred sermons from separate texts in the Sermon on the Mount. There is,
                    however, no recorded instance of his having treated that Sermon as a whole
                    anywhere else. Evidently, he was prepared to allow this series, once published,
                    to stand as his sufficient comment on the subject.</p>
                <p>In his introduction to ‘Discourse X’, §§1-3, Wesley repeats his explanation (cf.
                    ‘Discourse I’, Proem, §10) of how he had conceived the design of Matthew 5-7,
                    according to its three unfolding themes: (1) ‘the sum of true religion’; (2)
                    ‘rules touching that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward
                    actions’; and (3) ‘the main hindrances of this religion’. He then adds a
                    clarifying summary: ‘In the fifth chapter [of St. Matthew] our great Teacher…has
                    laid before us those <hi rend="italic">dispositions of the soul</hi> which
                    constitute real Christianity…. In the sixth [chapter] he has shown how all our
                        <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>…may be made holy, and good, and acceptable to
                    God, by a pure and holy intention…. In <pb n="468"/>the former part of [ch. 7]
                    he points out the most common and fatal hindrances of this holiness; in the
                    latter [part] he exhorts us, by various motives, to break through all [such
                    hindrances] and secure that prize of our high calling [of God in Christ Jesus]’
                    (cf. Phil. 3:14).</p>
                <p>The thirteen discourses are divided almost equally over the three chapters of St.
                    Matthew: five for chapter five, four each for six and seven. Of the first five,
                    Discourse I is devoted to the first two Beatitudes; Discourse II to Beatitudes
                    three through five (with a hymn to love based on 1 Cor. 13); Discourse III to
                    the remainder of the Beatitudes; Discourse IV turns to Christianity as ‘a social
                    religion’ in which inward holiness (our love of God) prompts outward holiness
                    (love of neighbour); Discourse V is a balancing of law <hi rend="italic">and</hi> gospel. Discourses VI-IX are based on chapter six: VI to the
                    problems of purity and holiness of intention (to the ‘works of piety and of
                    mercy’); VII to fasting; VIII to a denunciation of greed and surplus
                    accumulation; IX to the mutually exclusive services of God and Mammon.
                    Discourses X-XIII turn to various hindrances to holy living and to their
                    avoidance: X to ‘judging’ (contrary to love), ‘intemperate zeal’, ‘neglect of
                    prayer’, ‘neglect of charity’; XI to the noxious influences of ill-example and
                    ill-advice with which the world deludes us; XII to false prophets and unedifying
                    preachers (and yet also our duties to attend church nonetheless and to avail
                    ourselves of all means of grace); XIII is an inevitable comment on the parable
                    of the houses built on sand and rock. Discourse XII was also published
                    separately in the same year that it appeared in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, III
                    (1750), under the title, ‘A Caution Against False Prophets. A Sermon on Matt.
                    vii. 15-20. Particularly recommended to the People Called Methodists’. This went
                    through seven editions during Wesley’s lifetime. For a stemma delineating the
                    publishing history of that sermon (‘collected’ and ‘separate’) and a list of
                    variant readings, see Appendix, ‘Wesley’s Text’, Vol. IV, see also <hi rend="italic">Bibliog</hi>, Nos. 130 and 13o.i.</p>
                <p>Obviously there is no interest, in any of these sermons, in critical textual
                    problems or in the historical context. Everywhere it is assumed that in St.
                    Matthew’s text we are dealing with divine <hi rend="italic">ipsissima
                    verba</hi>—i.e., with a direct address from ὁ ὤν, ‘the self-existent, the
                    Supreme, the God who is over all, blessed for ever’ (§9 below). The Sermon on
                    the Mount, in Wesley’s view, is the only Gospel passage where Christ designed
                    ‘to lay down at once the whole plan of his religion, to give us a full prospect
                    of Christianity’. What matters most in our reading, therefore, is an awareness
                    of Wesley’s sense of the wholeness of the message he is interpreting, of his
                    conviction of the honest integration of an evangel profoundly ethical with an
                    ethic that is also vividly <pb n="469"/>evangelical. Maybe more than anywhere
                    else in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi> this particular bloc displays Wesley’s
                    distinctive concern for integration and balance—between the faith that justifies
                    and the faith that works by love.</p>

                    various branches. He has laid before us those <pb n="573"/>dispositions of soul
                    which constitute real Christianity: the inward tempers contained in that
                    holiness ‘without which no man shall see the Lord’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">

                    affections which, when flowing from their proper fountain, from a living faith
                    in God through Christ Jesus, are intrinsically and essentially good, and
                    acceptable to God. He proceeds to show in this chapter how all our actions
                    likewise, even those that are indifferent in their own nature, may be made holy
                    and good and acceptable to God, by a pure and holy intention. Whatever is done
                    without this, he largely declares, is of no value before God. Whereas whatever
                    outward works are thus consecrated to God, they are, in his sight, of great

                    some of our actions should be seen, and yet they may be acceptable to God. We
                    may intend that our ‘light’ should ‘shine before men’, when our conscience bears
                    us witness in the Holy Ghost that our ultimate end in designing they should ‘see

                            eminent Hungarian rabbi, Leopold Löw, who believed that the synagogue
                            (lit. ‘the place of meeting’) was designed as a public centre for many
                            functions in the community: the study of Torah, liturgical worship, and
                            social intercourse. For a contemporary discussion of this problem, cf.

                    to be sounded before them in the most public parts of the city when they were
                    about to give any considerable alms. The pretended reason for this was to call
                    the poor together to receive it, but the <pb n="575"/>real design that they
                    might have praise of men. But be not thou like unto them. Do not thou cause a

                    honour which cometh of God only. ‘They’ who seek the praise of men ‘have their

                    all (for it must not be left undone: omit no opportunity of doing good, whether
                    secretly or openly) and with the doing it in the most effectual manner. For here
                    is also an exception to be made. When you are fully persuaded in your own mind

                    up thy heart to him, to pour out thy soul before him. Not ‘as the hypocrites’,
                    who ‘love’, or are wont, ‘to pray standing in the synagogues’, the exchange or

                    inform God, as though he knew not your wants already; but rather to inform
                    yourselves, to fix the sense of those wants more deeply in your hearts, and the
                    sense of your continual dependence on him who only is able to supply all your
                    wants. It is not so much to move God—who is always more ready to give than you
                    to ask—as to move yourselves, that you may be willing and ready to receive the
                    good things he has prepared for you.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18">

                    subjoins an example of it: even that divine form of prayer which seems in this
                    place to be proposed by way of pattern chiefly, as the model and standard of all
                    our prayers—‘After this manner therefore pray ye.’ Whereas elsewhere he enjoins
                    the use of these very words: ‘He said unto them, When ye pray, say….’<hi rend="endnote_reference">

                    contains all we can reasonably or innocently pray for. There is nothing which we
                    have need to ask of God, nothing which we can ask without offending him, which
                    is not included <pb n="578"/>either directly or indirectly in this comprehensive
                    form. Secondly, that it contains all we can reasonably or innocently desire;
                    whatever is for the glory of God, whatever is needful or profitable, not only
                    for ourselves, but for every creature in heaven and earth. And indeed our
                    prayers are the proper test of our desires, nothing being fit to have a place in
                    our desires which is not fit to have a place in our prayers; what we may not
                    pray for, neither should we desire. Thirdly, that it contains all our duty to
                    God and man; whatsoever things are pure and holy,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19">

                    preface, ‘Our Father which art in heaven’, lays a general foundation for prayer;
                    comprising what we must first know of God before we can pray in confidence of
                    being heard. It likewise points out to us all those tempers with which we are to
                    approach to God, which are most essentially requisite if we desire either our
                    prayers or our lives should find acceptance with him.</p>

                    creation, who are all interested in this grand event, the final renovation of
                    all things by God’s putting an end to misery and sin, to infirmity and death,

                        <p rend="footnote text">Note Wesley’s punctuation of this phrase,
                            thus accenting the petition that God’s will should ‘be done <hi rend="italic">on earth</hi>’ as it is, of course, in heaven. For
                            this, he has the authority of the AV and the 1662 BCP. Law’s <hi rend="italic">Serious Call</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>,

                            ‘thy will be done, [as well] in earth, as it is in heaven.’ But see John
                            Norris, <hi rend="italic">Practical Discourses</hi>, the last of which
                            is entitled, ‘Concerning Doing God’s Will on Earth…’. Wesley may have
                            had Norris’s description of ‘angelic obedience’ here in mind.</p>
                    </note>
                    as it is in heaven.’ This is the necessary and immediate consequence wherever
                    the kingdom of God is come; wherever God dwells in the soul by faith, and Christ
                    reigns in the heart by love.</p>
                <p>It is probable many, perhaps the generality of men, at the first view of these
                    words are apt to imagine they are only an expression of, or petition for,
                    resignation; for a readiness to suffer the will of God, whatsoever it be
                    concerning us. And this is unquestionably a divine and excellent temper, a most
                    precious gift of God. But this is not what we pray for in this petition, at
                    least not in the chief and primary sense of it. We pray, not so much for a
                    passive as for an active conformity to the will of God in saying, ‘Thy will be
                    done on earth as it is done in heaven.’</p>
                <p>How is it done by the angels of God in heaven? Those who now circle his throne

                    and blameless. They are altogether devoted to his will, and perfectly obedient
                    in all things.</p>
                <p>If we view this in another light, we may observe the angels of God in heaven do
                        <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the will of God. And they do nothing else, <pb n="584"/>&gt;nothing but what they are absolutely assured is his will. Again,
                    they do all the will of God <hi rend="italic">as</hi> he willeth, in the manner
                    which pleases him, and no other. Yea, and they do this only <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it is his will; for this and no other reason.</p>
                <p n="10">10. When therefore we pray that the ‘will of God’ may ‘be done on earth as
                    it is in heaven’, the meaning is that all the inhabitants of the earth, even the
                    whole race of mankind, may do the will of their Father which is in heaven as <hi rend="italic">willingly</hi> as the holy angels; that these may do it <hi rend="italic">continually</hi>, even as they, without any interruption of
                    their willing service. Yea, and that they may do it <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi>; that ‘the God of peace, through the blood of the
                    everlasting covenant, may make them perfect in every good work to do his will,

                    he, ‘ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive
                    you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father

                    may show us some degree of mercy. But we will not suffer him to blot out all our

                    That is, in plain terms, ‘Do not thou forgive us at all; we desire no favour at

                    wrath may abide upon us.’ But can you seriously offer such a prayer to God? And

                            doxology here, as in the AV and in Tyndale, Cranmer, and Geneva, but not
                            in the <hi rend="italic">TR</hi>, nor in Wycliffe or Douai. Blackall,
                                <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, II.616-26, takes the doxology for
                            granted, as had the BCP and Anglicans generally. It is, of course,
                            lacking from the earliest MSS of St. Matthew; Origen (<hi rend="italic">On Prayer</hi>, ch. 30, §3) seems unaware of any such addition. In
                            the Latin Mass, the Paternoster ends with <hi rend="italic">Libera nos a

                            repeating it. One may, therefore, wonder if Wesley knew the actual text
