                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 21-33]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>The unifying theme of these next thirteen ‘discourses’ on the Sermon on the
                    Mount, with all their variations and nuancings, is the Christian life understood
                    as the fruit of justifying faith. But given such faith, what follows? Wesley’s
                    answer is given in this extended exposition of the Christian life based on the
                        <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of evangelical ethics, ‘The Sermon on
                    the Mount’ (i.e., Matthew 5-7). Since Tyndale, this ‘sermon’ had been understood
                    as ‘the epitome of God’s laws and promises’ for Christian believers; cf.
                    Clebsch, <hi rend="italic">England’s Earliest Protestants</hi>, p. 184; see also
                    William Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Expository Notes…on the New Testament</hi>
                    (eleven editions between 1700 and 1739), Preface to chapter 5: ‘Christ’s famous
                    Sermon on the Mount comprehends the sum and substance of both the Old and New
                    Testaments.’</p>
                <p>Taken together, the following sermons are not a thirteen-part essay, tightly
                    organized and argued. Instead, they are separate sermons, drawn from materials
                    running back to 1725, arranged in a triadic pattern that seems to have been
                    original with Wesley. Each is a discourse in its own right; yet the series is
                    designed so that each appears as a part of a whole. This means that the sermons
                    may be read singly or together, but with an eye on their shared aim: ‘to assert
                    and prove every branch of <hi rend="italic">gospel obedience</hi> as
                    indispensably necessary to eternal salvation’; cf. Wesley’s open letter (Nov.
                    17, 1759) to John Downes in reply to the latter’s abusive <hi rend="italic"
                        >Methodism Examined and Exposed</hi> (1759).</p>
                <p>Many of the great and near-great commentators of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries had devoted their talents to the interpretation of Matthew 5-7 as the
                    principal summary of Christian ethics, or, in Henry Hammond’s phrase, as ‘an
                    abstract of Christian philosophy’; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Catechism</hi> (1st edn., <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1644), II.1, in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</hi> (1847), p. 83. Chief
                    among these earlier works, in the order of their influences upon Wesley’s
                    thought, were Bishop Offspring Blackall, ‘Eighty-Seven Practical Discourses Upon
                    Our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.1-561;
                    II.609-939; <pb n="01:467"/>John Norris, <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Discourses</hi>; the American, James Blair, <hi rend="italic">Our Saviour’s
                        Divine Sermon on the Mount in IV Volumes</hi> (1722; 2nd edn., 1740, with a
                    preface by Daniel Waterland); John Cardinal Bona, <hi rend="italic">Guide to
                        Eternity…</hi> (six editions in English between 1672 and 1712); and Henry
                    Hammond, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Echoes of all these are scattered along
                    the way, together with lesser borrowings from Bengel, Poole, and Henry. This
                    makes it all the more remarkable that Wesley came up with a model of his own,
                    both inform and substance. This series thus reminds us, yet again, of Wesley’s
                    ready appeal to tradition—even while he maintains his own originality and
                    independence.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Ingham records in his Journal that ‘during the voyage [to Georgia]
                    Wesley went over our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’ with the ship’s company
                    aboard the <hi rend="italic">Simmonds</hi>. There are also other records of his
                    preaching, very early on, from one or another text in Matthew 5-7. For example,
                    his second sermon was preached at Binsey (near Oxford), November 21, 1725, on
                    Matt. 6:33. A first draft of the sermon which appears here as ‘Discourse VIII’
                    seems to have been written out in 1736. Later, it was the example of the Sermon
                    on the Mount that encouraged Wesley to break out of his High Church prejudices
                    in Bristol, April 1, 1739: ‘In the evening (Mr. Whitefield being gone) I begun
                    expounding our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount (one pretty remarkable precedent of
                        <hi rend="italic">field preaching</hi>, though I suppose <hi rend="italic"
                        >there were churches</hi> at that time also) to a little society which was
                    accustomed to meet once or twice a week in Nicholas Street;’ cf. <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries for this whole story of the unplanned
                    outbreak of the Wesleyan Revival.</p>
                <p>The records show that, between 1739 and 1746, Wesley preached more than one
                    hundred sermons from separate texts in the Sermon on the Mount. There is,
                    however, no recorded instance of his having treated that Sermon as a whole
                    anywhere else. Evidently, he was prepared to allow this series, once published,
                    to stand as his sufficient comment on the subject.</p>
                <p>In his introduction to ‘Discourse X’, §§1-3, Wesley repeats his explanation (cf.
                    ‘Discourse I’, Proem, §10) of how he had conceived the design of Matthew 5-7,
                    according to its three unfolding themes: (1) ‘the sum of true religion’; (2)
                    ‘rules touching that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward
                    actions’; and (3) ‘the main hindrances of this religion’. He then adds a
                    clarifying summary: ‘In the fifth chapter [of St. Matthew] our great Teacher…has
                    laid before us those <hi rend="italic">dispositions of the soul</hi> which
                    constitute real Christianity…. In the sixth [chapter] he has shown how all our
                        <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>…may be made holy, and good, and acceptable to
                    God, by a pure and holy intention…. In <pb n="01:468"/>the former part of [ch.
                    7] he points out the most common and fatal hindrances of this holiness; in the
                    latter [part] he exhorts us, by various motives, to break through all [such
                    hindrances] and secure that prize of our high calling [of God in Christ Jesus]’
                    (cf. Phil. 3:14).</p>
                <p>The thirteen discourses are divided almost equally over the three chapters of St.
                    Matthew: five for chapter five, four each for six and seven. Of the first five,
                    Discourse I is devoted to the first two Beatitudes; Discourse II to Beatitudes
                    three through five (with a hymn to love based on 1 Cor. 13); Discourse III to
                    the remainder of the Beatitudes; Discourse IV turns to Christianity as ‘a social
                    religion’ in which inward holiness (our love of God) prompts outward holiness
                    (love of neighbour); Discourse V is a balancing of law <hi rend="italic"
                        >and</hi> gospel. Discourses VI-IX are based on chapter six: VI to the
                    problems of purity and holiness of intention (to the ‘works of piety and of
                    mercy’); VII to fasting; VIII to a denunciation of greed and surplus
                    accumulation; IX to the mutually exclusive services of God and Mammon.
                    Discourses X-XIII turn to various hindrances to holy living and to their
                    avoidance: X to ‘judging’ (contrary to love), ‘intemperate zeal’, ‘neglect of
                    prayer’, ‘neglect of charity’; XI to the noxious influences of ill-example and
                    ill-advice with which the world deludes us; XII to false prophets and unedifying
                    preachers (and yet also our duties to attend church nonetheless and to avail
                    ourselves of all means of grace); XIII is an inevitable comment on the parable
                    of the houses built on sand and rock. Discourse XII was also published
                    separately in the same year that it appeared in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, III
                    (1750), under the title, ‘A Caution Against False Prophets. A Sermon on Matt.
                    vii. 15-20. Particularly recommended to the People Called Methodists’. This went
                    through seven editions during Wesley’s lifetime. For a stemma delineating the
                    publishing history of that sermon (‘collected’ and ‘separate’) and a list of
                    variant readings, see Appendix, ‘Wesley’s Text’, Vol. IV, see also <hi
                        rend="italic">Bibliog</hi>, Nos. 130 and 13o.i.</p>
                <p>Obviously there is no interest, in any of these sermons, in critical textual
                    problems or in the historical context. Everywhere it is assumed that in St.
                    Matthew’s text we are dealing with divine <hi rend="italic">ipsissima
                    verba</hi>—i.e., with a direct address from ὁ ὤν, ‘the self-existent, the
                    Supreme, the God who is over all, blessed for ever’ (§9 below). The Sermon on
                    the Mount, in Wesley’s view, is the only Gospel passage where Christ designed
                    ‘to lay down at once the whole plan of his religion, to give us a full prospect
                    of Christianity’. What matters most in our reading, therefore, is an awareness
                    of Wesley’s sense of the wholeness of the message he is interpreting, of his
                    conviction of the honest integration of an evangel profoundly ethical with an
                    ethic that is also vividly <pb n="01:469"/>evangelical. Maybe more than anywhere
                    else in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi> this particular bloc displays Wesley’s
                    distinctive concern for integration and balance—between the faith that justifies
                    and the faith that works by love.</p>

                    the utter exclusion of good <pb n="01:593"/>works, not only from being the cause
                    of our justification (for we know that man is ‘justified freely by the
                    redemption which is in Jesus’)<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Rom. 3:24.</p></note> but from being the necessary
                    fruit of it—yea, from having any place in the religion of Jesus Christ. Others,
                    eager to avoid this dangerous mistake, have run as much too far the contrary
                    way; and either maintained that good works were the cause, at least the previous
                    condition, of justification, or spoken of them as if they were all in all, the
                    whole religion of Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p n="3">3. In the same manner have the end and the means of religion been set at
                    variance with each other. Some well-meaning men have seemed to place all
                    religion in attending the prayers of the church, in receiving the Lord’s Supper,
                    in hearing sermons, and reading books of piety; neglecting meantime the end of
                    all these, the love of God and their neighbour. And this very thing has
                    confirmed others in the neglect, if not contempt, of the ordinances of God, so
                    wretchedly abused to undermine and overthrow the very end they were designed to
                    establish.</p>
                <p n="4">4. But of all the means of grace there is scarce any concerning which men
                    have run into greater extremes than that of which our Lord speaks in the
                    above-mentioned words; I mean religious fasting. How have some exalted this

                <p n="1">I. 1. I shall endeavour to show, first, what is the nature of fasting, and
                    what the several sorts and degrees thereof. As to the nature of it, all the
                    inspired writers, both in the Old Testament and the New, take the word to ‘fast’
                    in one single sense, for not to eat, to abstain from food. This is so clear that
                    it would be labour lost to quote the words of David, Nehemiah, Isaiah, and the
                    prophets which followed, or of our Lord and his apostles; all agreeing in this:
                    that to fast is not to eat for a time prescribed.</p>
                <p n="2">2. To this other circumstances were usually joined by them of old, which
                    had no necessary connection with it. Such were the neglect of their apparel, the
                    laying aside those ornaments which they were accustomed to wear; the putting on
                    mourning, the strewing ashes upon their head, or wearing sackcloth next their
                    skin. But we find little mention made in the New Testament of any of these
                    indifferent circumstances; nor does it appear that any stress was laid upon them
                    by the Christians of the purer ages, however some penitents might voluntarily
                    use them as outward signs of inward humiliation. Much less did the apostles or
                    the Christians cotemporary with them beat or tear their own flesh. Such
                    ‘discipline’ as this was not unbecoming the priests or worshippers of Baal. The
                    gods of the heathens were but devils; and it was doubtless acceptable to their
                    devil-god when his priests <pb n="01:595"/>‘cried aloud, and cut themselves
                    after their manner, till the blood gushed out upon them’.<hi

                    his followers, who ‘came not to destroy men’s lives, but to save them’.<note

                <p n="3">3. As to the degrees or measures of fasting, we have instances of some who
                    have fasted several days together. So Moses, Elijah, and our blessed Lord, being
                    endued with supernatural strength for that purpose, are recorded to have fasted
                    without intermission ‘forty days and forty nights’.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p rend="footnote text">For Moses, see Exod. 34:38 and
                            Deut. 9:9,18; for Elijah, see 1 Kgs. 19:8; for Jesus, see Matt. 4:1-2.
                            Cf. Poole, <hi rend="italic">Annotations</hi> (Matt. 4:2): ‘…The like
                            did Moses before the Law, Elijah <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the law.
                            Christ does the same in the beginning of the Gospel…’; see also Henry,
                                <hi rend="italic">Exposition</hi>: ‘Christ…“fasted forty days and
                            forty nights” in compliance with the type and example of Moses, the

                            Testament.’</p></note> But the time of fasting more frequently mentioned
                    in Scripture is one day, from morning till evening. And this was the fast
                    commonly observed among the ancient Christians. But beside these they had also
                    their half-fasts (<hi rend="italic">semi-jejunia</hi>, as Tertullian styles
                        them<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13"><p rend="footnote text">Cf.

                    (Wednesday and Friday) throughout the year; on which they took no sustenance
                    till three in the afternoon, the time when they returned from the public
                        service.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14"><p rend="footnote text"><hi

                            Wesley and the Holy Club had stressed stationary fasts (as distinguished
                            from movable ones); he wrote a short piece on them—see Vol. 12 of this
                            edn.</p></note></p>
                <p n="4">4. Nearly related to this is what our Church seems peculiarly to mean by
                    the term ‘abstinence’; which may be used when we cannot fast entirely, by reason
                    of sickness or bodily weakness. This is the eating little; the abstaining in
                    part; the taking a smaller quantity of food than usual.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn15" n="15"><p rend="footnote text">Here, Chambers’s <hi

                            ‘fasting’).</p></note> I do not remember any scriptural instance of
                    this. But neither can I condemn it, for the Scripture does not. It may have its
                    use, and receive a blessing from God.</p>
                <p n="5">5. The lowest kind of fasting, if it can be called by that name, is the
                    abstaining from pleasant food. Of this we have several instances in Scripture,
                    besides that of Daniel and his brethren: who from a peculiar consideration,
                    namely, that they might ‘not defile themselves with the portion of the king’s
                    meat, nor with the wine which he drank’ (a ‘daily provision’ of which ‘the king
                    had <pb n="01:596"/>appointed for them’), ‘requested’ and obtained of ‘the
                    prince of the eunuchs’ ‘pulse to eat, and water to drink’.<hi
                        rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">Dan. 1:5,
                                etc. [8, 12].</p></note></hi> Perhaps from a mistaken imitation of
                    this might spring the very ancient custom of abstaining from flesh and wine
                    during such times as were set apart for fasting and abstinence; if it did not
                    rather arise from a supposition that these were the most pleasant food, and a
                    belief that it was proper to use what was least pleasing at those times of
                    solemn approach to God.</p>
                <p n="6">6. In the Jewish church there were some <hi rend="italic">stated</hi>
                    fasts. Such was the fast of the seventh month, appointed by God himself to be
                    observed by all Israel under the severest penalty. ‘The Lord spake unto Moses,
                    saying, […] on the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of
                    atonement; […] and ye shall afflict your souls…to make an atonement for you
                    before the Lord your God. For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted
                    in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.’<hi
                        rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p rend="endnote text">Lev.
                                23:26-29.</p></note></hi> In after ages several other stated fasts
                    were added to these. So mention is made by the prophet Zechariah of the fast,
                    not only ‘of the seventh’, but also of ‘the fourth, of the fifth, and of the
                    tenth month’.<hi rend="endnote_reference"><note place="end"><p

                <p>In the ancient Christian church there were likewise stated fasts, and those both
                    annual and weekly. Of the former sort was that before Easter, observed by some
                    for eight and forty hours; by others, for an entire week; by many for two weeks;
                    taking no sustenance till the evening of each day. Of the latter, those of the
                    fourth and sixth days of the week, observed (as Epiphanius writes, remarking it
                    as an undeniable fact) ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ οἰκουμένῃ—‘in the whole habitable earth’,<note

                            the Bridegroom shall be taken away, then shall they fast in those days.”
                            And the weekly too were observed throughout the whole church in

                    been occasional fasts appointed from time to time as the particular

                    is needful to sustain nature; much less for any delicacy or variety, being taken
                    up with quite different thoughts. Thus when Saul said, ‘I am sore distressed;
                    for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me;’ it is
                    recorded, ‘He had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.’<hi

                    together. And thus ‘David, […] and all the men that were with him’, when they
                    heard that ‘the people were fled from the battle, and that many of the people
                    were fallen and dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son were dead also’, ‘mourned,
                    and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and Jonathan, and for the house of

                <p>Nay, many times they whose minds are deeply engaged are impatient of any
                    interruption, and even loathe their needful food, as diverting their thoughts
                    from what they desire should engross their whole attention. Even as Saul, when
                    on the occasion mentioned before he had ‘fallen all along upon the earth, and
                    there was no strength in him’, yet ‘said, I will not eat’, till ‘his servants,

                <p n="2">2. Here then is the natural ground of fasting. One who is under deep
                    affliction, overwhelmed with sorrow for sin, and a strong apprehension of the
                    wrath of God, would without any rule, without knowing or considering whether it
                    were a command of God or not, ‘forget to eat his bread’, abstain not only from
                    pleasant, but even from needful food. Like St. Paul, who after he was ‘led into
                    Damascus, was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink’.<hi

                <quote>When men feel in themselves the heavy burden of sin, see damnation to be the

                    cannot but accuse themselves, and open their grief unto Almighty God, and call
                    unto him for mercy. This being done seriously, their mind is so occupied (taken
                    up), partly with sorrow and heaviness, partly with an earnest desire to be
                    delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all desire of meat and
                    drink is laid apart, and loathsomeness (or loathing) of all worldly things and
                    pleasure cometh in place; so that nothing then liketh them more than to weep, to

                <p n="3">3. Another reason or ground of fasting is this. Many of those who now fear
                    God are deeply sensible how often they have sinned against him by the abuse of
                    these lawful things. They know how much they have sinned by excess of food; how
                    long they have transgressed the holy law of God with regard to temperance, if
                    not sobriety too; how they have indulged their sensual appetites, perhaps to the
                    impairing even their bodily health, certainly to the no small hurt of their
                    soul. For hereby they continually fed and increased that sprightly folly, that
                    airiness of mind, that levity of temper, that gay inattention to things of the
                    deepest concern, that giddiness and carelessness of spirit, which were no other
                    than drunkenness of soul, which stupefied all their noblest faculties, no less
                    than excess of wine or strong drink. To remove therefore the effect they remove
                    the cause; they keep at a distance from all excess. They abstain, as far as is
                    possible, from what had wellnigh plunged them in everlasting perdition. They
                    often wholly refrain; always take care to be sparing and temperate in all
                    things.</p>
                <p n="4">4. They likewise well remember how fullness of bread<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn25" n="25"><p rend="footnote text">Ezek. 16:49.</p></note>
                    increased not only carelessness and levity of spirit but also foolish and unholy
                    desires, yea, unclean and vile affections. And this experience puts beyond all
                    doubt. Even a genteel, regular sensuality is continually sensualizing the soul,
                    and sinking it into a level with the beasts that perish.<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p rend="footnote text">Ps. 49:12, 20.</p></note> It
                    cannot be expressed what an effect variety and delicacy of food have on the mind
                    as well as the body; making it just ripe for every pleasure of sense, as soon as
                        <pb n="01:600"/>opportunity shall invite. Therefore on this ground also
                    every wise man will refrain his soul, and keep it low; will wean it more and
                    more from all those indulgences of the inferior appetites which naturally tend
                    to chain it down to earth, and to pollute as well as debase it. Here is another
                    perpetual reason for fasting: to remove the food of lust and sensuality, to
                    withdraw the incentives of foolish and hurtful desires, of vile and vain
                    affections.</p>
                <p n="5">5. Perhaps we need not altogether omit (although I know not if we should do
                    well to lay any great stress upon it) another reason for fasting which some good
                    men have largely insisted on: namely, the punishing themselves for having abused
                    the good gifts of God, by sometimes wholly refraining from them; thus exercising
                    a kind of holy revenge upon themselves for their past folly and ingratitude, in
                    turning the things which should have been for their health into an occasion of
                    falling. They suppose David to have had an eye to this when he said, ‘I wept and
                    chastened’ or punished ‘my soul with fasting;’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27"
                        n="27"><p rend="footnote text">Ps. 69:10.</p></note> and St. Paul, when he
                    mentions ‘what revenge’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn28" n="28"><p
                            rend="footnote text">2 Cor. 7:11.</p></note> godly sorrow occasioned in
                    the Corinthians.</p>
                <p n="6">6. A fifth and more weighty reason for fasting is that it is an help to
                    prayer; particularly when we set apart larger portions of time for private
                    prayer. Then especially it is that God is often pleased to lift up the souls of
                    his servants above all the things of earth, and sometimes to rap them up, as it
                    were, into the third heaven.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn29" n="29"><p
                            rend="footnote text">See 2 Cor. 12:2. <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> (which
                            cites this usage here) regards this as ‘a back-formation from “rapt”’
                            and dates its first example from 1599. By Wesley’s time, this spelling
                            was rare; it so confused his printers that both Pine and Paramore
                            spelled it ‘wrap’; they also printed ‘heavens’ for ‘heaven’.</p></note>
                    And it is chiefly as it is an help to prayer that it has so frequently been
                    found a means in the hand of God of confirming and increasing not one virtue,
                    not chastity only (as some have idly imagined, without any ground either from
                    Scripture, reason, or experience), but also seriousness of spirit, earnestness,
                    sensibility, and tenderness of conscience; deadness to the world, and
                    consequently the love of God and every holy and heavenly affection.</p>
                <p n="7">7. Not that there is any natural or necessary connection between fasting
                    and the blessings God conveys thereby. But he will have mercy as he will have
                        mercy:<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn30" n="30"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Rom. 9:18.</p></note> he will convey whatsoever seemeth him good, by
                    whatsoever means he is pleased to appoint. <pb n="01:601"/>And he hath in all
                    ages appointed this to be a means of averting his wrath, and obtaining whatever
                    blessings we from time to time stand in need of.</p>
                <p>How powerful a means this is to avert the wrath of God we may learn from the
                    remarkable instance of Ahab. ‘There was none like him, who did sell
                    himself’—wholly give himself up, like a slave bought with money—‘to work
                    wickedness.’ Yet when he ‘rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh,
                    and fasted, […] and went softly, the word of the Lord came to Elijah, saying,
                    Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? Because he humbleth himself
                    before me, I will not bring the evil in his days.’<note place="foot"

                <p>It was for this end, to avert the wrath of God, that Daniel sought God ‘with
                    fasting and sackcloth and ashes’. This appears from the whole tenor of his
                    prayer, particularly from the solemn conclusion of it: ‘O Lord, according to all
                    thy righteousnesses (or mercies), […] let thy anger be turned away from thy holy
                    mountain…. Hear the prayer of thy servant, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
                    sanctuary that is desolate…. O Lord, hear! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hearken and

                    is moved to seek him by fasting and prayer; but even from the heathens. When
                    Jonah had declared, ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed, the people
                    of Nineveh proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them
                    unto the least. For the King of Nineveh arose from his throne, and laid his robe
                    from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to
                    be proclaimed and published through Nineveh, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor
                    flock, taste anything. Let them not feed, nor drink water.’ (Not that the beasts
                    had sinned, or could repent; but that by their example man might be admonished,
                    considering that for his sin the anger of God was hanging over all creatures.)
                    ‘Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger,
                    that we perish not?’ And their labour was not in vain. The fierce anger of God
                    was turned away from them. ‘God saw their works’ (the fruits of that repentance
                    and faith which he had wrought in them by his prophet), ‘and God repented of the
                    evil that he had said he would do unto them; and he did it not.’<hi

                    fasted’ (doubtless for direction in this very affair) ‘the Holy Ghost said,

                    merely by the light of reason, or of natural conscience (as it is called), that
                    the people of God have been in all ages directed to use fasting as a means to
                    these ends. But they have been from time to time taught it of God himself, by
                    clear and open revelations of his will. Such is that remarkable one by the
                    prophet Joel: ‘Therefore thus saith the Lord, Turn you unto me with all your
                    heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning…. Who knoweth if
                    the Lord will return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him? […] Blow the
                    trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly…. Then will the Lord be
                    jealous over his land, and will spare his people. Yea, […] I will send you corn
                    and wine and oil…. I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen.’<hi

                <p>Nor are they only temporal blessings which God directs his people to expect in
                    the use of these means. For at the same time that he promised to those who
                    should seek him with fasting, and weeping, and mourning, ‘I will render you the

                    give alms, and to pray, are of the same force with such injunctions. For the

                <p>View your argument in its full dimensions, and you will easily judge of the

                <p>If a Christian ought to abstain from sin, then he ought not to abstain from

                <p>Therefore he ought not to abstain from food.</p>
                <p>That a Christian ought to abstain from sin is most true. But how does it follow
                    from hence that he ought not to abstain from food? Yea, let him do both the one
                    and the other. Let him, by the grace of God, always abstain from sin; and let
                    him often abstain from food, for such reasons and ends as experience and
                    Scripture plainly show to be answered thereby.</p>
                <p n="2">2. ‘But is it not better’ (as it has, secondly, been objected) ‘to abstain
                    from pride and vanity, from foolish and hurtful desires,<note place="foot"

                    peevishness, and anger, and discontent, than from food?’ Without question it is.
                    But here again we have need to remind you of our Lord’s words, ‘These things
                    ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.’<note place="foot"

                    is a means to that great end. We abstain from food with this view, that by the
                    grace of God, conveyed into our souls through this outward means, in conjunction
                    with all the other channels of his grace which he hath appointed, we may be

                    argument proves just the contrary to what you designed. It proves that we ought
                    to fast. For if we ought to abstain from evil tempers and desires, then we ought

                    have fasted much and often. But what did it avail? We were not a whit better: we
                    found no blessing therein. Nay, we have found it an hindrance rather than an
                    help. Instead of preventing anger, for instance, or fretfulness, it has been a
                    means of increasing them to such a height that we could neither bear others nor
                    ourselves.’ This may very possibly be the case. ’Tis possible either to fast or
                    pray in such a manner as to make you much worse than before; more unhappy, and
                    more unholy. Yet the fault does not lie in the means itself, but in the <hi

                    they still ‘approved themselves the ministers of God, by fastings’, as well as

                    anything (as we have seen above) wherein the glory of God was nearly concerned,

                    well as prayer.</p>
                <p n="5">5. ‘But if fasting be indeed of so great importance, and attended with such
                    a blessing, is it not best’, say some, fifthly, ‘to fast always? Not to do it
                    now and then, but to keep a continual fast? To use as much abstinence at all
                    times as our bodily strength will bear?’ Let none be discouraged from doing
                    this. By all means use as little and plain food, exercise as much self-denial
                    herein at all times, as your bodily strength will bear. And this may conduce, by
                    the blessing of God, to several of the great ends above-mentioned. It may be a
                    considerable help not only to chastity, but also to heavenly-mindedness; to the
                    weaning your affections from things below, and setting them on things
                        above.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn49" n="49"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Col. 3:2.</p></note> But this is not fasting, scriptural fasting; it is
                    never termed so in all the Bible. It in some measure answers some of the ends
                    thereof, but still it is another thing. Practise it by all means; but not so as
                        <pb n="01:607"/>thereby to set aside a command of God, and an instituted
                    means of averting his judgments, and obtaining the blessings of his
                    children.</p>
                <p n="6">6. Use continually then as much abstinence as you please; which taken thus
                    is no other than Christian temperance. But this need not at all interfere with
                    your observing solemn times of fasting and prayer. For instance: your habitual
                    abstinence or temperance would not prevent your fasting in secret if you was
                    suddenly overwhelmed with huge sorrow and remorse, and with horrible fear and
                    dismay. Such a situation of mind would almost constrain you to fast; you would
                    loathe your dainty food; you would scarce endure even to take such supplies as
                    were needful for the body, till God lifted you up ‘out of the horrible pit, and
                    set your feet upon a rock, and ordered your goings’.<note place="foot"

                    The same would be the case if you was in agony of desire, vehemently wrestling
                    with God for his blessing.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn51" n="51"><p
                            rend="footnote text">See Gen. 32:24-32.</p></note> You would need none

                <p n="7">7. Again, had you been at Nineveh when it was proclaimed throughout the

                    your continual fast have been any reason for not bearing part in that general
                    humiliation? Doubtless it would not. You would have been as much concerned as
                    any other not to taste food on that day.</p>
                <p>No more would abstinence, or the observing a continual fast, have excused any of
                    the children of Israel from fasting on the tenth day of the seventh month, the
                    great annual day of atonement. There was no exception for these in that solemn
                    decree, ‘Whatsoever soul it shall be that shall not be afflicted’ (shall not
                    fast) ‘in that day, he shall be cut off from among his people.’<note

                    would soon have been cut off from the Christian community. You would have

                <p n="1">IV. 1. I am, in the last place, to show in what manner we are to fast, that
                    it may be an acceptable service <hi rend="italic">unto the Lord</hi>. And,
                    first, let it be done unto the Lord, with our eye singly fixed on him. Let our
                    intention herein be this, and this alone, to glorify our Father which is in
                    heaven; to express our sorrow and shame for our manifold transgressions of his
                    holy law; to wait for an increase of purifying grace, drawing our affections to
                    things above; to add seriousness and earnestness to our prayers; to avert the
                    wrath of God, and to obtain all the great and precious promises which he hath
                    made to us in Christ Jesus.</p>
                <p>Let us beware of mocking God, of turning our fast as well as our prayer into an
                    abomination unto the Lord, by the mixture of any temporal view, particularly by
                    seeking the praise of men. Against this our blessed Lord more peculiarly guards
                    us in the words of the text: ‘Moreover, when ye fast, be ye not as the
                    hypocrites’ (such were too many who were called the people of God), ‘of a sad
                    countenance’; sour, affectedly sad, putting their looks into a peculiar form;
                    ‘for they disfigure their faces’, not only by unnatural distortions, but also by
                    covering them with dust and ashes, ‘that they may appear unto men to fast’. This
                    is their chief, if not only design. ‘Verily, I say unto you, they have their
                    reward’—even the admiration and praise of men. ‘But thou, when thou fastest,
                    anoint thy head, and wash thy face’—do as thou art accustomed to do at other
                    times—‘that thou appear not unto men to fast’ (let this be no part of thy
                    intention: if they know it without any desire of thine it matters not; thou art
                    neither the better nor the worse), ‘but unto thy Father which is in secret; and
                    thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.’<note place="foot"

                        <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> anything of God by our fasting. We cannot be
                    too often warned of this; inasmuch as a desire to ‘establish our own
                        righteousness’,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn56" n="56"><p

                    God hath ordained wherein we wait for his <hi rend="italic">unmerited</hi>
                    mercy; and wherein, without any desert of ours, he hath promised <hi

                <p n="3">3. Not that we are to imagine the performing the bare outward act will
                    receive any blessing from God. ‘Is it such a fast that I have chosen?’ saith the
                    Lord. ‘A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a
                    bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?’ Are these outward acts,
                    however strictly performed, all that is meant by a man’s ‘afflicting his soul’?
                    ‘Wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?’<note

                    lost labour. Such a performance may possibly afflict the body. But as to the
                    soul, it profiteth nothing.</p>
                <p n="4">4. Yea, the body may sometimes be afflicted too much, so as to be unfit for
                    the works of our calling. This also we are diligently to guard against; for we
                    ought to preserve our health, as a good gift of God. Therefore care is to be
                    taken, whenever we fast, to proportion the fast to our strength. For we may not
                    offer God murder for sacrifice, or destroy our bodies to help our souls.</p>
                <p>But at these solemn seasons we may, even in great weakness of body, avoid that
                    other extreme for which God condemns those who of old expostulated with him for
                    not accepting their fast. ‘Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest
                    not?’ ‘Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,’ saith the Lord.<note
