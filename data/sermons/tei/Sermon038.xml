                <p>Part of the price of peace in eighteenth-century Britain, after the bitter
                    quarrels of Civil War and Restoration, was a general lessening of partisan zeal
                    and bigotry. The latitudinarians had made a positive virtue of toleration.
                    Others had accepted it grudgingly as the lesser of two evils. The main concern
                    of all, in both church and civil state, was surcease from religious turmoil. It
                    was, therefore, inevitable that the Methodist Revival should revive fears of new
                    religious disruptions; and Wesley’s claim to an extraordinary vocation, his
                    blithe disregard for parish boundaries and for the conventions of ministerial
                    courtesy, along with his employment of lay preachers in busy rotation across the
                    three kingdoms, did nothing to allay such fears. In his interview with Joseph
                        Butler<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            above, p. 44.</p></note> the bishop’s brusque judgment betrayed a
                    genuine anxiety: ‘Well sir, since you ask my advice, I will give it to you very
                    freely. You have no business here; you are not commissioned to preach in this
                    diocese. Therefore, I advise you to go hence.’ Wesley’s calm defiance in his
                    response summed up his evangelical self-understanding then and thereafter:</p>
                <quote>My Lord, my business on earth is to do what good I can. Wherever, therefore,
                    I think I can do most good, there must I stay, so long as I think so. At present
                    I think I can do most good here; therefore here I stay. As to my preaching here,
                    a dispensation of the Gospel is committed to me, and woe is me if I preach not
                    the Gospel, wherever I am in the habitable world. Your Lordship knows, being
                    ordained a priest, by the commission I then received I am a priest of the church
                    universal. And being ordained a Fellow of a College, I was not limited to any
                    particular cure, but have an indeterminate commission to preach the word of God
                    in any part of the Church of England. I do not therefore conceive that, in
                    preaching here by this commission, I break any human law. When I am convinced I
                    do, then it will be time to ask, ‘Shall I obey God or man?’ But if I should be
                    convinced in the meanwhile, that I could advance the glory of God, and the
                    salvation of souls in any other place, more than in Bristol; in that hour, by
                    God’s help, I will go hence; which till then I may not do.<note place="foot"

                <p>He had already made a similar declaration in a letter to an unnamed <pb

                    are willing to hear the glad tidings of salvation. This is the work which I know
                    God has called me to. And sure I am that his blessing attends it.<note

                <p>Thus, in much the same way that the Methodists had come by the label
                    ‘enthusiasts’, they also had come to be regarded as ‘bigots’ in the current
                    general sense of ‘excessive or irrational zealots’; cf. Johnson’s definition in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>, and see also Chambers’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cyclopaedia</hi>, for a quaint story about the term’s coinage, <hi
                        rend="italic">viz.</hi>, in a courtly outburst of outraged dignity: ‘No, <hi
                        rend="italic">by-God!</hi>’. With the Revival now in full flood, and with
                    Wesley as sole head of a tightly organized, highly partisan group of zealous
                    preachers and people, there was an obvious occasion for a carefully considered
                    statement about proper and improper zeal addressed to critics and to Methodists
                    alike—‘a caution against bigotry’, defined as ‘too strong an attachment to, or
                    fondness for, our own party, opinion, church, and religion’.<note place="foot"

                <p>In this sermon Wesley studiously avoids an apologetic stance. Rather, he will
                    redefine the problem by asking about the proper business of true apostles and
                    answering it by reference to the gospel story of the casting out of devils
                    (taken here as a metaphor for the whole conflict between Christ and the forces
                    of evil and also for the ministry of salvation). Does it really matter who may
                    venture this task and who may be forbidden it—and on what grounds? Would it
                    really be better for evil to go unchallenged, souls to go unsaved, if this were
                    not to be done ‘properly’? Given his predictable answers to such questions,
                    Wesley is then able to argue that valid ministry should be measured by fruits
                    rather than forms. Further, he will imply that churchmen might, indeed, be
                    actually grateful for the work of the Methodists and that, in their turn, the
                    Methodists should renounce all bigotry discovered within themselves. In effect,
                    this is a positive, if also indirect, plea for a carefully considered religious
                    pluralism both in theology and praxis.</p>
                <p>There is no record of any other instance of Wesley’s using Mark <pb n="02:063"
                    />9:38-39 as a sermon text—from which we may infer that it was written on
                    purpose for this particular time and occasion. But its underlying pragmatism can
                    be seen as essential in Wesley’s concepts of theological method and of Christian
                        <hi rend="italic">community-in-diversity</hi>. Thus, it was a useful
                    rejoinder to those who took Methodist bigotry as a matter of course and yet also
                    a timely antidote to Methodist ‘zeal without knowledge’; for a sequel, see No.

                <p n="">1. In the preceding verses we read that after the twelve had been disputing
                    ‘which of them should be the greatest’, Jesus ‘took a little child, and set him
                    in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms said unto them, Whosoever shall
                    receive one of these little children in my name receiveth me; and whosoever
                    receiveth me receiveth not me (only), but him that sent me.’<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn5" n="5"><p rend="footnote text">See Mark 9:34, 36-37.</p></note>
                    Then ‘John answered’ (that is, said with reference to what our Lord had spoken
                    just before), ‘Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and we forbade
                    him, because he followeth not us.’ As if he had said: ‘Ought we to have received
                    him? In receiving him, should we have received thee? Ought we not rather to have
                    forbidden him? Did not we do well therein?’ ‘But Jesus said, Forbid him
                    not.’</p>
                <p n="2">2. The same passage is recited by St. Luke, and almost in the same words.
                    But it may be asked: ‘What is this to us? Seeing no man now “casts out devils”.
                    Has not the power of doing this been withdrawn from the church for twelve or
                    fourteen hundred years? How then are <hi rend="italic">we</hi> concerned in the
                    case here proposed, or in our Lord’s decision of it?’</p>
                <p n="3"><pb n="02:064"/>3. Perhaps more nearly than is commonly imagined, the case
                    proposed being no uncommon case. That we may reap our full advantage from it I
                    design to show, first, in what sense men may, and do now, ‘cast out devils’;
                    secondly, what we may understand by, ‘He followeth not us.’ I shall, thirdly,
                    explain our Lord’s direction, ‘Forbid him not,’ and conclude with an inference
                    from the whole.</p>

            <div type="section" n="1">
                <p n="1">I. 1. I am, in the first place, to show in what sense men may, and do now,
                    ‘cast out devils’.</p>
                <p>In order to have the clearest view of this we should remember that (according to
                    the scriptural account) as God dwells and works in the children of light, so the
                    devil dwells and works in the children of darkness. As the Holy Spirit possesses
                    the souls of good men, so the evil spirit possesses the souls of the wicked.
                    Hence it is that the Apostle terms him ‘the god of this world’<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="footnote text">2 Cor. 4:4.</p></note>—from the
                    uncontrolled power he has over worldly men. Hence our blessed Lord styles him
                    ‘the prince of this world’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p
                            rend="footnote text">John 12:31, etc.</p></note>—so absolute is his
                    dominion over it. And hence St. John, ‘We know that we are of God,’ and all who
                    are not of God, ‘the whole world’, ἐν τῷ πονηρῷ κεῖται<note place="foot"

                    actions, by keeping possession of their hearts, setting up his throne there, and
                    bringing every thought into obedience to himself. Thus the ‘strong one armed
                    keepeth his house’; and if this ‘unclean spirit’ sometime ‘go out of a man’, yet
                    he often returns with ‘seven spirits worse than himself; and they enter in and

                    world still possesses all who know not God. Only the manner wherein he possesses
                    them now differs from that wherein he did it of old time. Then he frequently
                    tormented their bodies as well as souls, and that openly, without any disguise;
                    now he torments their souls only (unless in some rare cases) and that as
                    covertly as possible. The reason of this difference is plain. It was then his
                    aim to drive mankind into superstition. Therefore he wrought as openly as he
                    could. But ’tis his aim to drive <hi rend="italic">us</hi> into infidelity.

                            ‘the Whig supremacy’ for thirty-five disapproving years.</p></note> This
                    has been particularly observable in our own countrymen, who have been
                    continually dividing from each other upon points of no moment, and many times
                    such as religion had no concern in. The most trifling circumstances have given
                    rise to different parties, which have continued for many generations. And each
                    of these would be ready to object to one who was on the other side, ‘He
                    followeth not us.’</p>

                    There was a time when all Christians were of one mind, as well as of one
                        heart.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34"><p rend="footnote text">See
                            Acts 4:32.</p></note> So great grace was upon them all when they were
                    first filled with the Holy Ghost. But how <hi n="02:070"/> short a space did
                    this blessing continue! How soon was that unanimity lost, and difference of
                    opinion sprang up again, even in the church of Christ! And that not in nominal
                    but in real Christians; nay, in the very chief of them, the apostles themselves!
                    Nor does it appear that the difference which then began was ever entirely
                    removed. We do not find that even those pillars in the temple of God, so long as
                    they remained upon earth, were ever brought to think alike, to be of one mind,
                    particularly with regard to the ceremonial law. ’Tis therefore no way surprising
                    that infinite varieties of opinion should now be found in the Christian church.
                    A very probable consequence of this is that whenever we see any ‘casting out
                    devils’ he will be one that in this sense ‘followeth not us’—that is not of our
                    opinion. ’Tis scarce to be imagined he will be of our mind in all points, even
                    of religion. He may very probably think in a different manner from us even on
                    several subjects of importance, such as the nature and use of the moral law, the
                    eternal decrees of God, the sufficiency and efficacy of his grace, and the
                    perseverance of his children.</p>

                    which is practised in our congregation, and may judge that to be more profitable
                    for his soul which took its rise from Calvin, or Martin Luther.<note

                            reflection of Wesley’s unselfconscious Anglicanism; his own tradition is
                            not Calvinist or Lutheran, not even Puritan. In other places he freely
                            passes judgment on Calvin and on Luther (cf. No. 104, ‘On Attending the
                            Church Service’, §25; and his letter to Mrs. Hutton, Aug. 22, 1744: ‘I

                    of beyond all others, many doubts concerning that form of church government
                    which we esteem both apostolical and scriptural. Perhaps he may go farther from
                    us yet: he may, from a principle of conscience, refrain from several of those
                    which we believe to be the ordinances of Christ. Or if we both agree that they
                    are ordained of God, there may still remain a difference between us either as to
                    the manner of administering those ordinances or the persons to whom they should
                    be administered. Now the unavoidable consequence of any of these differences
                    will be that he who thus differs from us must separate himself with regard to

                    necessary consequence of this will be, they will speak in the same manner as
                    they think of us. They will set themselves in opposition to us, and, as far as
                    they are able hinder our work, seeing it does not appear to them to be the work

                <p n="1">IV. 1. If we willingly fail in any of these points, if we either directly
                    or indirectly forbid him ‘because he followeth not us’, then we are ‘bigots’.
                    This is the inference I draw from what has been said. But the term ‘bigotry’, I
                    fear, as frequently as it is used, is almost as little understood as
                    ‘enthusiasm’. It is too strong an attachment to, or fondness for, our own party,
                    opinion, Church, and religion. Therefore he is a bigot who is so fond of any of
                    these, so strongly attached to them, as to forbid any who casts out devils,
                    because he differs from himself in any or all these particulars.</p>

                    believe that any man does cast out devils who differs from you. And if you are
                    clear thus far, if you acknowledge the fact, then examine yourself, secondly:
                    ‘Am I not convicted of bigotry in this, in forbidding him directly or
                    indirectly? Do I not directly forbid him on this ground, because he is not of my

                <p n="3">3. Examine yourself: ‘Do I not indirectly, at least, forbid him on any of
                    these grounds? Am I not sorry that God should thus own and bless a man that
                    holds such erroneous opinions? Do I not discourage him because he is not of my
                    Church? By disputing with him concerning it, by raising objections, and by
                    perplexing his mind with distant consequences? Do I show no anger, contempt, or
                    unkindness of any sort, either in my words or actions? Do I not mention behind
                    his back his (real or supposed) faults? His defects or infirmities? Do not I

                    convicting myself of bigotry. Yea, if it could be supposed that I should see a
                    Jew, a deist, or a Turk doing the same, were I to forbid him either directly or
                    indirectly I should be no better than a bigot still.</p>
                <p n="5">5. O stand clear of this. But be not content with not forbidding any that

                    rejoice in his work, and praise his name with thanksgiving. Encourage whomsoever

                    can his sphere of action. Show him all kindness in word and deed. And cease not
                    to cry to God in his behalf, that he may save both himself and them that hear
