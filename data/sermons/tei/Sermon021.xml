            <p>Greg Van Buskirk created Word docs for all of Wesley's sermons using a combination of
                OCR software and manual proofing. Michelle Taylor converted these docx into XML
                using Oxygen's DITA automatic transformation scenario, then touched them up

                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 21-33]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>The unifying theme of these next thirteen ‘discourses’ on the Sermon on the
                    Mount, with all their variations and nuancings, is the Christian life understood
                    as the fruit of justifying faith. But given such faith, what follows? Wesley’s
                    answer is given in this extended exposition of the Christian life based on the
                        <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of evangelical ethics, ‘The Sermon on
                    the Mount’ (i.e., Matthew 5-7). Since Tyndale, this ‘sermon’ had been understood
                    as ‘the epitome of God’s laws and promises’ for Christian believers; cf.
                    Clebsch, <hi rend="italic">England’s Earliest Protestants</hi>, p. 184; see also
                    William Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Expository Notes…on the New Testament</hi>
                    (eleven editions between 1700 and 1739), Preface to chapter 5: ‘Christ’s famous
                    Sermon on the Mount comprehends the sum and substance of both the Old and New
                    Testaments.’</p>
                <p>Taken together, the following sermons are not a thirteen-part essay, tightly
                    organized and argued. Instead, they are separate sermons, drawn from materials
                    running back to 1725, arranged in a triadic pattern that seems to have been
                    original with Wesley. Each is a discourse in its own right; yet the series is
                    designed so that each appears as a part of a whole. This means that the sermons
                    may be read singly or together, but with an eye on their shared aim: ‘to assert
                    and prove every branch of <hi rend="italic">gospel obedience</hi> as
                    indispensably necessary to eternal salvation’; cf. Wesley’s open letter (Nov.
                    17, 1759) to John Downes in reply to the latter’s abusive <hi rend="italic">Methodism Examined and Exposed</hi> (1759).</p>
                <p>Many of the great and near-great commentators of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries had devoted their talents to the interpretation of Matthew 5-7 as the
                    principal summary of Christian ethics, or, in Henry Hammond’s phrase, as ‘an
                    abstract of Christian philosophy’; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Catechism</hi> (1st edn., <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1644), II.1, in the <hi rend="italic">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</hi> (1847), p. 83. Chief
                    among these earlier works, in the order of their influences upon Wesley’s
                    thought, were Bishop Offspring Blackall, ‘Eighty-Seven Practical Discourses Upon
                    Our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.1-561;
                    II.609-939; <pb n="467"/>John Norris, <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Discourses</hi>; the American, James Blair, <hi rend="italic">Our Saviour’s
                        Divine Sermon on the Mount in IV Volumes</hi> (1722; 2nd edn., 1740, with a
                    preface by Daniel Waterland); John Cardinal Bona, <hi rend="italic">Guide to
                        Eternity…</hi> (six editions in English between 1672 and 1712); and Henry
                    Hammond, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Echoes of all these are scattered along
                    the way, together with lesser borrowings from Bengel, Poole, and Henry. This
                    makes it all the more remarkable that Wesley came up with a model of his own,
                    both inform and substance. This series thus reminds us, yet again, of Wesley’s
                    ready appeal to tradition—even while he maintains his own originality and
                    independence.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Ingham records in his Journal that ‘during the voyage [to Georgia]
                    Wesley went over our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’ with the ship’s company
                    aboard the <hi rend="italic">Simmonds</hi>. There are also other records of his
                    preaching, very early on, from one or another text in Matthew 5-7. For example,
                    his second sermon was preached at Binsey (near Oxford), November 21, 1725, on
                    Matt. 6:33. A first draft of the sermon which appears here as ‘Discourse VIII’
                    seems to have been written out in 1736. Later, it was the example of the Sermon
                    on the Mount that encouraged Wesley to break out of his High Church prejudices
                    in Bristol, April 1, 1739: ‘In the evening (Mr. Whitefield being gone) I begun
                    expounding our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount (one pretty remarkable precedent of
                        <hi rend="italic">field preaching</hi>, though I suppose <hi rend="italic">there were churches</hi> at that time also) to a little society which was
                    accustomed to meet once or twice a week in Nicholas Street;’ cf. <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries for this whole story of the unplanned
                    outbreak of the Wesleyan Revival.</p>
                <p>The records show that, between 1739 and 1746, Wesley preached more than one
                    hundred sermons from separate texts in the Sermon on the Mount. There is,
                    however, no recorded instance of his having treated that Sermon as a whole
                    anywhere else. Evidently, he was prepared to allow this series, once published,
                    to stand as his sufficient comment on the subject.</p>
                <p>In his introduction to ‘Discourse X’, §§1-3, Wesley repeats his explanation (cf.
                    ‘Discourse I’, Proem, §10) of how he had conceived the design of Matthew 5-7,
                    according to its three unfolding themes: (1) ‘the sum of true religion’; (2)
                    ‘rules touching that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward
                    actions’; and (3) ‘the main hindrances of this religion’. He then adds a
                    clarifying summary: ‘In the fifth chapter [of St. Matthew] our great Teacher…has
                    laid before us those <hi rend="italic">dispositions of the soul</hi> which
                    constitute real Christianity…. In the sixth [chapter] he has shown how all our
                        <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>…may be made holy, and good, and acceptable to
                    God, by a pure and holy intention…. In <pb n="468"/>the former part of [ch. 7]
                    he points out the most common and fatal hindrances of this holiness; in the
                    latter [part] he exhorts us, by various motives, to break through all [such
                    hindrances] and secure that prize of our high calling [of God in Christ Jesus]’
                    (cf. Phil. 3:14).</p>
                <p>The thirteen discourses are divided almost equally over the three chapters of St.
                    Matthew: five for chapter five, four each for six and seven. Of the first five,
                    Discourse I is devoted to the first two Beatitudes; Discourse II to Beatitudes
                    three through five (with a hymn to love based on 1 Cor. 13); Discourse III to
                    the remainder of the Beatitudes; Discourse IV turns to Christianity as ‘a social
                    religion’ in which inward holiness (our love of God) prompts outward holiness
                    (love of neighbour); Discourse V is a balancing of law <hi rend="italic">and</hi> gospel. Discourses VI-IX are based on chapter six: VI to the
                    problems of purity and holiness of intention (to the ‘works of piety and of
                    mercy’); VII to fasting; VIII to a denunciation of greed and surplus
                    accumulation; IX to the mutually exclusive services of God and Mammon.
                    Discourses X-XIII turn to various hindrances to holy living and to their
                    avoidance: X to ‘judging’ (contrary to love), ‘intemperate zeal’, ‘neglect of
                    prayer’, ‘neglect of charity’; XI to the noxious influences of ill-example and
                    ill-advice with which the world deludes us; XII to false prophets and unedifying
                    preachers (and yet also our duties to attend church nonetheless and to avail
                    ourselves of all means of grace); XIII is an inevitable comment on the parable
                    of the houses built on sand and rock. Discourse XII was also published
                    separately in the same year that it appeared in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, III
                    (1750), under the title, ‘A Caution Against False Prophets. A Sermon on Matt.
                    vii. 15-20. Particularly recommended to the People Called Methodists’. This went
                    through seven editions during Wesley’s lifetime. For a stemma delineating the
                    publishing history of that sermon (‘collected’ and ‘separate’) and a list of
                    variant readings, see Appendix, ‘Wesley’s Text’, Vol. IV, see also <hi rend="italic">Bibliog</hi>, Nos. 130 and 13o.i.</p>
                <p>Obviously there is no interest, in any of these sermons, in critical textual
                    problems or in the historical context. Everywhere it is assumed that in St.
                    Matthew’s text we are dealing with divine <hi rend="italic">ipsissima
                    verba</hi>—i.e., with a direct address from ὁ ὤν, ‘the self-existent, the
                    Supreme, the God who is over all, blessed for ever’ (§9 below). The Sermon on
                    the Mount, in Wesley’s view, is the only Gospel passage where Christ designed
                    ‘to lay down at once the whole plan of his religion, to give us a full prospect
                    of Christianity’. What matters most in our reading, therefore, is an awareness
                    of Wesley’s sense of the wholeness of the message he is interpreting, of his
                    conviction of the honest integration of an evangel profoundly ethical with an
                    ethic that is also vividly <pb n="469"/>evangelical. Maybe more than anywhere
                    else in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi> this particular bloc displays Wesley’s
                    distinctive concern for integration and balance—between the faith that justifies
                    and the faith that works by love.</p>

                    have contained the Twelve. Nor does it in any wise appear that the ‘disciples
                    who came unto him’ were the Twelve only. Οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, without any force put

                    undeniably plain that where it is said, ‘He opened his mouth and taught them,’
                    the word ‘them’ includes all the multitudes who went up with him into the
                    mountain, we need only observe the concluding verses of the seventh chapter:
                    ‘And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the multitudes, οἱ
                    ὄχλοι, were astonished at his doctrine (or teaching). For he taught <hi rend="italic">them</hi> (the multitudes) as one having authority, and not as

                            the intended auditory of the Sermon on the Mount had exercised most of
                            the commentators. Henry, <hi rend="italic">Exposition</hi>, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, had insisted that the ‘discourse was
                            directed to the disciples [only], though in the hearing of the

                            that the ‘sermon was designed only for his own disciples…’; later, John
                            Heylyn makes the distinction even more sharply in <hi rend="italic">Theological Lectures</hi>, I.74. But Hammond, <hi rend="italic">Practical Catechism</hi>, p. 84, had remarked that the term
                            ‘disciple’ was ‘of latitude enough to contain <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                            Christians…; what is said in this sermon, all Christians are concerned

                    the apostles, or the first Christians, or the ministers of Christ; and were

                            than its usual reading as an imperative. But he accepts Blackall’s
                            qualification that ‘it would be very absurd for any <hi rend="italic">private</hi> discourse to be given so prominent a place in a public

                <p>But may we not justly inquire who told them this—that some parts of this
                    discourse concerned only the apostles, or the Christians of the apostolic age,
                    or the ministers of Christ? Bare assertions are not a sufficient proof to
                    establish a point of so great importance. Has then our Lord himself taught us
                    that some parts of his discourse do not concern all mankind? Without doubt had
                    it been so he would have told us; he could not have omitted so necessary an
                    information. But has he told us so? Where? In the discourse itself? No: here is
                    not the least intimation of it. Has he said so elsewhere? In any other of his
                    discourses? Not one word so much as glancing this way can we find in anything he
                    ever spoke, either to the multitudes or to his disciples. Has any of the
                    apostles, or other inspired writers, left such an instruction upon record? No
                    such thing. No assertion of this kind is to be found in all the oracles of God.

                    accounts: because without such a restriction the discourse would either be
                    apparently absurd, or would contradict some other Scripture. But this is not the
                    case. It will plainly appear, when we come to examine the several particulars,
                    that there is no absurdity at all in applying all which our Lord hath here
                    delivered to all mankind. Neither will it infer any contradiction to anything
                    else he has delivered, nor to any other Scripture whatever. Nay, it will farther
                    appear that either all the parts of this discourse are to be applied to men in
                    general or no part; seeing they are all connected together, all joined as the
                    stones in an arch, of which you cannot take one away without destroying the

                            crucial example of Wesley’s twin principles of hermeneutics. The first
                            is that Scripture is Scripture’s own best interpreter; thus, ‘the
                            analogy of faith’ (i.e., one’s sense of the whole) should govern one’s
                            exegesis of each part; cf. No. 5, ‘Justification by Faith’, §2 and n.).
                            The second is that one begins, always, with a literal translation and
                            holds to it unless it should lead into a palpable absurdity; in which
                            case, analogy and even allegory become allowable options. Cf. Nos. 74,

                    </note> Here therefore our Lord begins:

                <p>It may not improbably be supposed that our Lord, looking on those who were round
                    about him, and observing that not many rich were there, but rather the poor of
                    the world, took occasion from thence to make a transition from temporal to
                    spiritual things. ‘Blessed’, saith he (or <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>: so the
                    word should be rendered both in this and the following verses) ‘are the poor in
                    spirit.’ He does not say they that are poor as to <hi rend="italic">outward
                        circumstances</hi> (it being not impossible that some of these maybe as far
                    from happiness as a monarch upon his throne) but ‘the poor in <pb n="476"/>spirit’; they who, whatever their outward circumstances are, have that
                    disposition of heart which is the first step to all real, substantial happiness,
                    either in this world or that which is to come.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn43" n="43">

                    love poverty; those who are free from covetousness, from the love of money; who
                    fear rather than desire riches. Perhaps they have been induced so to judge by
                    wholly confining their thought to the very term, or by considering that weighty
                    observation of St. Paul, that ‘the love of money is the root of all evil.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn44" n="44">

                    </note> And hence many have wholly divested themselves, not only of
                    riches, but of all worldly goods. Hence also the vows of voluntary poverty seem
                    to have arisen in the Romish Church; it being supposed that so eminent a degree
                    of this fundamental grace must be a large step toward the kingdom of
                        heaven.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn45" n="45">
                        <p rend="footnote text">Cf.
                            Blackall, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.7: ‘…the Papists…who do so
                            much magnify voluntary poverty…. And in this sense Maldonate, and divers
                            others of the popish commentators, do expound this passage…. But this
                            interpretation is perfectly groundless and also manifestly false.’ The
                            reference here is to Johannes Maldonatus (1534-83), Spanish exegete and
                            theologian, whose chief work was <hi rend="italic">Commentarii in
                                Quattuor Evangelistas</hi> (2 vols., 1596-97, and many later edns.,
                            none in English until 1888). It is worth noting that Wesley has already
                            begun to inveigh against surplus accumulation and ‘the danger of
                            riches’; cf. Discourse VIII, below, reflecting as it does the counsels
                            of Richard Lucas and William Law against greed and self-indulgence—and
                            about voluntary poverty as the Christian counterweight to the dangers of
                            riches. This will become a lifelong theme of Wesley’s, and his emphasis
                            on it will increase with the passing years and growing affluence amongst
                            the Methodists.</p>

                </p>
                <p>But these do not seem to have observed, first, that the expression of St. Paul
                    must be understood with some restriction; otherwise it is not true. For the love
                    of money is not ‘the root’—the sole root—‘of all evil’. There are a thousand
                    other roots of evil in the world, as sad experience daily shows. His meaning can
                    only be, it is the root of very many evils; perhaps of more than any single vice
                    besides. Secondly, that this sense of the expression ‘poor in spirit’ will by no
                    means suit our Lord’s present design, which is to lay a general foundation
                    whereon the whole fabric of Christianity may be built; a design which would be
                    in no wise answered by guarding against one particular vice: so that even if
                    this were supposed to be one part of his meaning, it could not possibly be the
                    whole. Thirdly, that it cannot be supposed to be any part of his meaning unless
                    we charge him with <pb n="477"/>manifest tautology: seeing if ‘poverty of
                    spirit’ were only freedom from covetousness, from the love of money, or the
                    desire of riches, it would coincide with what he afterwards mentions; it would
                    be only a branch of ‘purity of heart’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46" n="46">

                            prevenient work of the Holy Spirit, but it involves human ‘re-action’,
                                <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, recognition of one’s alienation from

                            to covetousness or…to pride and highmindedness.’ On p. 16 the phrase is
                            more clearly defined as ‘humility’, although for Norris ‘poverty of
                            spirit’ is more nearly self-abasement than self-knowledge as in Wesley.

                    fall into that huge abyss. Stop! I will not go on for all the world.’ When the
                    other, who seemed to himself at least equally sharp-sighted, looked forward and
                    saw nothing of all this, what would he think of his companion but that ‘he was
