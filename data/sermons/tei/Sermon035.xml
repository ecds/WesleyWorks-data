                <p>The most patent danger in Wesley’s delicate balancing of faith alone and holy
                    living was its possible tilt toward moralism (‘<hi rend="italic">inherent</hi>
                    righteousness’); something of this sort did eventually occur in Methodism after
                    Wesley’s death, despite all his earnest efforts to safeguard his gospel against
                    it. But the opposite extreme, antinomianism, was already a clear and present
                    danger among the Methodists; several versions of it were even then being
                    vigorously asserted, as if antinomianism were a valid consequence of ‘faith
                    alone’. This controversy had emerged with the Revival itself, in Wesley’s
                    disagreements with the Moravians (cf. JWJ, November 1, 1739, April 19-26, 1740).
                    It had been carried forward by the reckless rhetoric of men like William
                    Cudworth, minister of the Grey Eagle Street Church in London, although Wesley
                    had found its substance in the more sophisticated teachings of James Hervey and
                    others.</p>
                <p>In 1741 (September 3) Wesley had debated the issue of faith and good works with
                    Count von Zinzendorf in London. Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> record
                    of this passage at arms, along with his earlier denunciations of Whitefield’s
                    ‘Calvinism ’, etc., had drawn fire from the antinomians (and from some
                    Calvinists). In 1745, Cudworth had published a twenty-five page <hi
                        rend="italic">Dialogue Between a Preacher of God’s Righteousness and a
                        Preacher of Inherent Righteousness</hi>, in which he spoke ‘for God’ and
                    allowed Wesley to speak for ‘inherent righteousness’; cf. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Christ Alone Exalted</hi> (1747), in which Cudworth’s tract is No. VIII.
                    The urgency of this is evident from the manuscript Minutes of the second Annual
                    Conference in Bristol, August 2,1745, in Questions 24-26 and their answers:</p>
                <quote>Q. 24. Wherein may we come to the very edge of antinomianism?</quote>
                <quote>A. (1). In exalting the merits and love of Christ.</quote>
                <quote>(2). In rejoicing evermore.</quote>
                <quote>><pb n="02:002"/>Q. 25. What can we do to stop the progress of
                    antinomianism?</quote>
                <quote>A. (1). Pray without ceasing that God would speak for himself.</quote>
                <quote>(2). Write one or two more dialogues.</quote>
                <quote>Q. 26. Doth faith supersede (set aside the necessity of holiness or good
                    works?</quote>
                <quote>A. <hi rend="italic">In no wise. So far from it that it implies both, as a
                        cause doth its effects.</hi></quote>
                <p>The proposed ‘one or two more dialogues’ promptly appeared in the same year: <hi
                        rend="italic">A Dialogue between an Antinomian and his Friend</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">A Second Dialogue between an Antinomian and his Friend</hi>.
                    The first dialogue was a sort of reenactment of the 1741 debate with Zinzendorf,
                    with Zinzendorf’s original words now translated from the Latin and with Wesley’s
                    original replies revised. The second pamphlet was Wesley’s rejoinder to
                    Cudworth’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>; it concludes with what was intended
                    to be a recapitulation of the discussion as a whole. Unsurprisingly, though,
                    these dialogues had not concluded the affair, as we see from many <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries over the ensuing five years (see
                    especially October 30 and December 11, 1749, etc.). It was, therefore, both
                    urgent and appropriate for Wesley to follow his thirteen sermons on the Sermon
                    on the Mount with three additional sermonic essays on the complex, dynamic
                    interdependence of ‘Law and Gospel’ in his doctrine of salvation. This was the
                    aim and occasion of the following sermons.</p>
                <p>Despite their complex development, the sermon outlines are plain and simple. The
                    ‘original’ of the Law is man’s inborn moral sense—not ‘natural’ in the deist
                    sense but, rather, as an aspect of the residual <hi rend="italic">imago
                    Dei</hi>. The ‘nature’ of the Law is <hi rend="italic">Christological</hi>, as
                    if Torah and Christ are in some sense to be equated. The ‘properties’ of the Law
                    are threefold, and here Wesley follows the standard Puritan exegesis of Rom.
                    7:12 as to the Law’s holiness and its instrumentality in the delineation of the
                    just and the good. Incidentally, seven of the eight contemporary editions of
                    this sermon here read ‘properties’, in the plural; only the text of <hi
                        rend="italic">Works</hi> (1771) has ‘property’ (but both Jackson and Sugden
                    seem to have preferred the singular). Wesley’s brief discussion of the ‘uses of
                    the Law’ ignores the fact of the extended debate over ‘the <hi rend="italic"
                        >third</hi> use of the Law’ between the Lutherans and the Calvinists, and
                    obscures the further fact that Wesley has come down squarely on the Puritan side
                    of the argument: the threefold ‘use’ of the Law is to convict, convert, <hi
                        rend="italic">and sustain the believer</hi>—in and after justification (see
                    below, No. 34, IV.1 and n.).</p>
                <p><pb n="02:003"/>The twin discourses entitled ‘The Law Established through Faith’
                    amount to a single essay in two parts. In the first, Wesley turns on his critics
                    and charges them with ‘voiding the Law’ by (1) ‘not preaching it at all’, and
                    (2) by preaching ‘faith’ so as to ‘supersede the necessity of holiness’. In the
                    second part, he argues that the Law is and ought to be ‘established <hi
                        rend="italic">by faith</hi>’: (1) by a doctrine in which salvation by faith
                    is understood as the foundation on which the whole enterprise of Christian
                    living must rest; (2) by preaching ‘faith alone’ so as to promote ‘holiness’
                    rather than to supersede or subordinate it; and (3) by the manifestation of holy
                    living in Christian hearts and lives.</p>
                <p>What we have here, then, is a further variation on the central theme of the
                    preceding thirteen sermons: the distinctive character of evangelical ethics in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">fides caritate formata</hi> is always the consequent
                    of the <hi rend="italic">sola fide</hi>, never its alternative. They also have
                    in them (Discourse II, II.1-6) one of Wesley’s most interesting and original
                    proposals: that ‘faith is in order to love’ and, therefore, that ‘love will
                    exist after faith’—which may or may not be an amendment of 1 Cor. 13:13; cf.
                    Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> on this verse: ‘Faith, hope, and love are
                    the sum of perfection on earth; love alone is the sum of perfection in
                    heaven.’</p>
                <p>These sermons were ‘tracts for the times’ and not the distillate of oral
                    preaching. This appears from the fact that we have no record of Wesley’s having
                    preached on Rom. 7:12, ever, and there are only two clear references to his use
                    of Rom. 3:31 (June 27 and August 2, 1741). A possible third reference may be in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry for April 25, 1745: ‘I preached at
                    Little Horton and Bradford.’ Here I ‘could not but observe how God has made void
                    all their labour who “make void the law through faith”.’ More than likely,
                    though, this is either a comment on a local circumstance or, at most, one of the
                    ‘heads’ in a sermon with another, unspecified text. For a publishing history of
                    Nos. 34-36 and a list of variant readings in their successive texts, see

                    which he commonly terms justification. And that all men stood in need of this,
                    that none could plead their own innocence, he proves at large by various
                    arguments addressed to the Jews as well as the heathens. Hence he infers (in the
                    nineteenth verse of this chapter) ‘that every mouth’, whether of Jew or heathen,
                    must ‘be stopped’ from excusing or justifying himself, ‘and all the world become
                    guilty before God. Therefore’, saith he, by his own obedience, ‘by the works of
                    the law, shall no flesh be justified in his sight.’<hi rend="endnote_reference"

                    (which was the grand position he had undertaken to establish) ‘that a man is

                <p n="2">2. It was easy to foresee an objection which might be made, and which has
                    in fact been made in all ages; namely, that to say ‘we are justified without the
                    works of the law’ is to abolish the law. The Apostle, without entering into a
                    formal dispute, simply denies the charge. ‘Do we then’, says he, ‘make void the
                    law through faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the law.’</p>
                <p n="3">3. The strange imagination of some<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p
                            rend="footnote text"><hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi>, the Anabaptists and

                    says, ‘A man is justified without the works of the law,’ means only the <hi
                        rend="italic">ceremonial</hi> law, is abundantly confuted by these very

                    It is evident he did not. He did ‘make void’ that law through faith, and openly

                    the law through faith’. Now the way for a preacher to make it all void at a
                    stroke is not to preach it at all. This is just the same thing as to blot it out
                    of the oracles of God. More especially when it is done with design; when it is
                    made a rule, ‘not to preach the law’—and the very phrase, ‘a preacher of the
                    law’, is used as a term of reproach, as though it meant little less than ‘an
                    enemy to the gospel’.</p>
                <p n="2">2. All this proceeds from the deepest ignorance of the nature, properties,
                    and use of the law; and proves that those who act thus either know not Christ,
                    are utter strangers to the living faith, or at least that they are but babes in
                    Christ, and as such ‘unskilled in the word of righteousness’.<note place="foot"

                <p n="3">3. Their grand plea is this, that preaching the gospel (that is, according
                    to their judgment, the speaking of nothing but the sufferings and merits of
                    Christ) answers all the ends of the law. But this we utterly deny. It does not
                    answer the very first end of the law, namely, the convincing men of sin, the
                    awakening those who are still asleep on the brink of hell. There may have been
                    here and there an exempt case. One in a thousand may have been awakened by the
                    gospel. But this is no general rule. The ordinary method of God is to convict
                    sinners by the law, and that only.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn12" n="12"><p

                    any more ground to expect this from the nature of the thing. ‘They that be
                    whole’, as our Lord himself observes, ‘need not a physician, but they that be

                    to convince them that they are sick; otherwise they will not thank you for your
                    labour. It is equally absurd to offer Christ to them whose heart is whole,
                    having never yet been broken. It is, in the proper sense, ‘casting pearls before
                    swine’. Doubtless ‘they will trample them under foot’; and it is no more than
                    you have reason to expect if they also ‘turn again and rend you’.<note

                    or the Acts of the Apostles. Neither can you prove this to have been the
                    practice of any of the apostles from any passage in all their writings.</p>

                <p>We consent to rest the cause on this issue: to tread in his steps, to follow his

                <p n="6">6. The very first sermon of St. Paul’s which is recorded concludes in these
                    words: ‘By him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye
                    could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore lest that come upon
                    you which is spoken of in the Prophets: Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and
                    perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which you will in no <pb

                    the law’, in the sense wherein you understand the term; even although great part
                    of, if not all, his hearers were either ‘Jews or religious proselytes’<hi

                    degree at least, convinced of sin already. He first reminds them that they could
                    not be justified by the law of Moses, but only by faith in Christ; and then
                    severely threatens them with the judgments of God, which is, in the strongest
                    sense, ‘preaching the law’.</p>

                    Christ. The whole purport of it is that they should ‘turn from those vain idols
                    unto the living God’. Now confess the truth. Do not you think if you had been
                    there you could have preached much better than he? I should not wonder if you

                    not there preach at all, not in that sense wherein we speak; for ‘preaching’ in
                    our present question means speaking before a congregation. But waiving this I
                    answer, (2), his epistles are directed, not to unbelievers, such as those we are
                    now speaking of, but to ‘the saints of God’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn17"
                        n="17"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Rom. 1:7, etc.</p></note> in Rome,
                    Corinth, Philippi, and other places. Now unquestionably he would speak more of
                    Christ to these than to those who were without God in the world. And yet, (3),
                    every one of these is full of the law, even the Epistles to the Romans and the
                    Galatians, in both of which he does what you term preaching the law, and that to
                    believers as well as unbelievers.</p>
                <p n="10">10. From hence ’tis plain you know not what it is to ‘preach Christ’, in
                    the sense of the Apostle. For doubtless St. Paul judged himself to be preaching
                    Christ both to Felix, and at Antioch, Lystra, and Athens: from whose example
                    every thinking man must infer that not only the declaring the love of Christ to
                    sinners, but also the declaring that he will come from heaven in flaming fire,
                    is, in the Apostle’s sense, ‘preaching Christ’. Yea, in the full scriptural
                    meaning of the word. To preach Christ is to preach what he hath revealed, either
                    in the Old or New Testament; so that you are then as really preaching Christ
                    when you are saying, ‘The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the people
                    that forget God,’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18" n="18"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Ps. 9:17 (BCP).</p></note> as when you are saying,
                    ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!’<note

                <p n="11">11. Consider this well: that to ‘preach Christ’ is to preach all things
                    that Christ hath spoken: all his promises; all his threatening and commands; all
                    that is written in his Book. And then you will know how to preach Christ without
                    making void the law.</p>
                <p n="12">12. ‘But does not the greatest blessing attend those discourses wherein we
                    peculiarly preach the merits and sufferings of Christ?’</p>
                <p>Probably, when we preach to a congregation of mourners or of believers, these
                    will be attended with the greatest blessing; because such discourses are
                    peculiarly suited to their state. At least these will usually convey the most
                    comfort. But this is not always the greatest blessing. I may sometimes receive a
                    far greater by a discourse that cuts me to the heart and humbles me to the dust.
                    Neither should I receive that comfort if I were to preach or <pb n="02:026"/>to
                    hear no discourses but on the sufferings of Christ. These by constant repetition
                    would lose their force, and grow more and more flat and dead, till at length

                    that faith supersedes the necessity of holiness. This divides itself into a
                    thousand smaller paths—and many there are that walk therein. Indeed there are
                    few that wholly escape it; few who are convinced we ‘are saved by faith’ but are

                    judgment that faith in Christ entirely sets aside the necessity of keeping his
                    law, yet suppose either, (1), that holiness is less necessary now than it was
                    before Christ came; or, (2), that a less degree of it is necessary; or, (3),
                    that it is less necessary to believers than to others. Yea, and so are all those

                    was fully and properly under that covenant, which required perfect, universal
                    obedience, as the one condition of acceptance, and left no place for pardon,
                    upon the very least transgression. But no man else was ever under this, neither
                    Jew nor Gentile, neither before Christ nor since. All his sons were and are
                    under the covenant of grace. The manner of their acceptance is this: the free
                    grace of God, through the merits of Christ, gives pardon to them that believe,
                    that believe with such a faith as, working by love, produces all obedience and

                    Whereas now all good works, though as necessary as ever, are not antecedent to

                <p n="5">5. When you was under conviction, you durst not indulge the lust of the eye
                    in any degree. You would not do anything, great or small, merely to gratify your
                    curiosity. You regarded only cleanliness and necessity, or at most very moderate
                    convenience, either in furniture or apparel; superfluity and finery of whatever
                    kind, as well as fashionable elegance, were both a terror and an abomination to
                    you.</p>
                <p>Are they so still? Is your conscience as tender now in these things as it was
                    then? Do you still follow the same rule both in furniture and apparel, trampling
                    all finery, all superfluity, everything useless, everything merely ornamental,
                    however fashionable, under foot? Rather, have you not resumed what you had once
                    laid aside, and what you could not then use without wounding your conscience?
                    And have you not learned to say, ‘Oh, I am not <hi rend="italic">so
                        scrupulous</hi> now.’ I would to God you were! Then you would not sin thus
                    ‘because you are not under the law, but under grace’.</p>
                <p n="6">6. You was once scrupulous, too, of commending any to their face; and still
                    more of suffering any to commend <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. It was a stab to
                    your heart; you could not bear it; you sought the honour that cometh of God
                    only. You could not endure such conversation, nor any conversation which was not
                    good to the use of edifying. All idle talk, all trifling discourse, you
                    abhorred; you hated as well as feared it, being deeply sensible of the value of
                    time, of every precious fleeting moment.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn34" n="34"
