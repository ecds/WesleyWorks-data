                </head>
                <p>This sermon carries us back to Wesley’s earlier conflicts with the Moravians and
                    other ‘quietists’ about the role and function of ‘ordinances’ in general and
                    their relation to the spontaneous experience of ‘assurance’ in particular. There
                    is no way of dating it exactly; Wesley has only a single mention of preaching on
                    Malachi 3:7 (JWJ, June 22, 1741). What is clear, however, is that a sizeable
                    group of Methodists in 1746 still continued to regard all ‘outward observances’
                    as superfluous, or even harmful, in their spiritual life. Considering themselves
                    to be true evangelicals, they understood their conversions and ‘baptisms of the
                    Spirit’ as having superseded their water baptisms, the Eucharist, and all other
                    sacramental acts (or ‘ordinances’ as they preferred to call them). It is these
                        <hi rend="italic">Methodist</hi> ‘quietists’ who are the primary audience
                    for this sermon. Wesley’s purpose is to enforce upon them the validity, and even
                    the necessity, of ‘the means of grace’ as taught and administered in the Church
                    of England.</p>
                <p>He could remember, better than they, how disruptive this issue had been in the
                    early days of the Revival, beginning with the new society in Fetter Lane.
                    Actually, the Fourth Extract from his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> is a
                    circumstantial account of his rift with the Moravians—and this question of
                    ordinances is a crucial issue in that dispute. Wesley’s view of the Moravian
                    position is summarized in his entry for Sunday, November 4, 1739:</p>
                <p>In the evening I met the women of our society at Fetter Lane, where some of our
                    brethren strongly intimated that none of them had any true faith, and then
                    asserted, in plain terms, (1), that till they had true faith, they ought to be
                    still, that is (as they explained themselves), ‘to abstain from “the means of
                    grace”, as they are called—the Lord’s Supper in particular’; (2), ‘that the
                    ordinances are not means of grace, there being no other means than Christ’.</p>
                <p>His own, Anglican, conclusion is given in the entry for the following Wednesday
                    (November 7):</p>
                <p rend="Quote">What is to be inferred from this undeniable matter of fact<hi rend="italic">—one that had not faith received it in the Lord’s Supper?</hi>
                    Why (1), that there are ‘means of grace’, i.e., outward ordinances, whereby the
                    inward grace of God is ordinarily conveyed to man, <pb n="377"/>whereby the
                    faith that brings salvation is conveyed to them who before had it not; (2), that
                        <hi rend="italic">one of these means is the Lord’s Supper;</hi> and (3),
                    that <hi rend="italic">he who has not this faith ought to wait for it in the use
                        both of this and of the other means which God hath ordained</hi>.</p>
                <p>The upshot of this controversy had been Wesley’s abandonment of the Fetter Lane
                    society, his forming of the new society in Upper Moorfields at the Foundery, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> his constant advocacy thereafter of an equal emphasis
                    upon ‘conversion’ and ‘assurance’, on the one hand, and a faithful, expectant
                    usage of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> ‘the means of grace’, on the other. The
                    result is a sort of ‘high-church’ evangelicalism—a rare combination, then and
                    since.</p>
                <p>The controverted phrase, ‘the means of grace’, appears (apparently for the first
                    time) in ‘The General Thanksgiving’ in the BCP of 1661-62 and was, quite
                    probably, the contribution of Bishop Edward Reynolds of Norwich, a former
                    Nonconformist and still something of a ‘puritan’ in his theology. Wesley also
                    cites a phrase from the <hi rend="italic">Catechism</hi> as composed for the
                    Prayer Book of James I and re-incorporated in the 1662 version. The question,
                    ‘What meanest thou by this word <hi rend="italic">Sacrament</hi>?’ is answered
                    thus: ‘I mean an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given
                    unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a <hi rend="italic">means</hi> whereby
                    we receive the same, and a pledge to <hi rend="italic">assure us</hi> thereof’
                    (emphasis added). Following the Ordinal (1550, and only slightly revised in
                    1661-62) used at Wesley’s own ordination as priest, he had vowed ‘always…to
                    minister the doctrine and Sacraments, and the discipline, of Christ…’ and to ‘be
                    diligent in prayers, and in the reading of the Holy Scriptures and in such
                    studies as help to the knowledge of the same…’. Finally, he knew how carefully
                    intertwined faith, prayer, the Sacraments, and Scripture had been in the
                    Edwardian Homilies. An eminent Anglican liturgiologist, Professor Massey
                    Shepherd, has written, in response to a personal inquiry on this point:
                    ‘Wesley’s threefold “means of grace” have a sound basis in the official Anglican
                    formularies: Prayer Book, Ordinal, Homilies, Catechism.’</p>
                <p>But how to appropriate this tradition for people whose sacramental sense had
                    atrophied and whose spontaneous experiences of grace were so much more vivid
                    than their usual experiences of its ordinances and means? How to make clear the
                    difference between the proper use and possible abuse of such means or to suggest
                    how strenuous a ‘waiting upon the Lord’ (II.7, III.1, IV.4-5) can, and should
                    be, in the Christian life? These are the tasks attempted in this ‘discourse’
                    (II.1).</p>

                    unless by one who openly avowed himself to be a heathen, the whole body of
                    Christians being agreed that Christ had ordained certain outward means for
                    conveying his grace into the souls of men. Their constant practice set this
                    beyond all dispute; for so long as ‘all that believed were together, and had all

                    himself. In his Sermon upon the Mount, after explaining at large wherein
                    religion consists, and describing the main branches of it, he adds: ‘Ask, and it
                    shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
                    you. For everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to

                    peculiar manner. He appeals to every man’s own heart: ‘What man is there of you,
                    who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he
                    give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
                    your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven’—the Father of
                    angels and men, the Father of the spirits of all flesh—‘give good things to them

                    </hi> It should be particularly observed here
                    that the persons directed to ask had not then received the Holy Spirit.
                    Nevertheless our Lord directs them to use this means, and promises that it
                    should be effectual; that upon asking they should receive the Holy Spirit from
                    him whose mercy is over all his works.</p>

                    from God yet farther appears from that remarkable passage which immediately
                    precedes these words: ‘And he said unto them’ (whom he had just been teaching
                    how to pray) ‘which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at
                    midnight, and shall say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; …and he from
                    within shall answer, Trouble me not…. I cannot rise and give thee: I say unto
                    you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because
                    of his importunity he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth. And I say
                    unto you, ask and it shall be given you.’<hi rend="endnote_reference">

                    pray, and not to faint,’ till through this means they should receive of God
                    whatsoever petition they asked of him: ‘There was in a city a judge which feared
                    not God, neither regarded man. And there was a widow in that city, and she came
                    unto him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary. And he would not for a while; but
                    afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet

                            not in the first two) Wesley had decided that it meant ‘a plain command

                            of the early Fathers (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and the Latin

                            here, though he inclined to the imperative; but Poole, <hi rend="italic">Annotations</hi>, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, had recognized
                            that ‘the words may be read imperatively (as our translation [AV]

                    ‘All Scripture is given by inspiration of God’ (consequently, all Scripture is

                    these; not because they are of weight in themselves, but because they have so

                <p>The first and chief of these is, ‘You cannot use these means (as you call them)

                    I expect you should show me plain Scripture for your assertion; otherwise I dare
                    not receive it, because I am not convinced that you are wiser than God.</p>
                <p>If it really had been as you assert, it is certain Christ must have known it. And
                    if he had known it, he would surely have warned us; he would have revealed it

                    the whole revelation of Jesus Christ, I am as fully assured your assertion is
                    false as that this revelation is of God.</p>
                <p>‘However, leave them off for a short time to see whether you trusted in them or
                    no.’ So I am to disobey God in order to know whether I trust in obeying him! And
                    do you avow this advice? Do you deliberately teach to ‘do evil, that good may
                    come’? O tremble at the sentence of God against such teachers! Their ‘damnation

                    that whatever God hath promised he is faithful also to perform. And seeing he

                    works’? In the writings of St. Paul it means either seeking to be saved by
                    observing the ritual works of the Mosaic law, or expecting salvation for the
                    sake of our own works, by the merit of our own righteousness. But how is either
                    of these implied in my waiting in the way God has ordained, and expecting that
                    he will meet me there because he has promised so to do?</p>
                <p>I do expect that he will fulfil his Word, that he will meet and bless me in this
                    way. Yet not for the sake of any works which I have done, nor for the merit of
                    my righteousness; but merely through the merits and sufferings and love of his

                    may not wholly pass it by.</p>
                <p>‘Does not St. Paul say, “If ye be dead with Christ, why are ye subject to <hi rend="italic">ordinances</hi>?”<hi rend="endnote_reference">

                    a Christian, one that is “dead with Christ”, need not use the ordinances any

                <p>So you say, ‘If I am a Christian I am not subject to the ordinances of Christ!’
                    Surely, by the absurdity of this you must see at the first glance that the
                    ordinances here mentioned cannot be the ordinances of Christ! That they must
                    needs be the Jewish ordinances, to which it is certain a Christian is no longer
                    subject.</p>

                <p>So that this objection is the weakest of all. And in spite of all, that great
                    truth must stand unshaken: that all who desire the grace of God are to wait for

                        <p rend="footnote text">I.e., the ritual
                            observance itself. The Reformers had charged that the Roman Catholics
                            taught that the bare, ritual observance of the Mass conferred saving
                            grace, <hi rend="italic">apart from faith</hi>. It was this charge to
                            which Canon VIII of Trent (Seventh Session) was responding: <hi rend="italic">Si quis dixerit per ipsa novae legis sacramenta ex
                                opere operato non conferri gratiam…</hi> (‘against those who say
                            that, under the New Law, grace is not conferred by the sacraments on the
                            basis of the ritual observance itself…’). The Roman position was that
                            some benefit is conveyed by the Eucharist even when not received in
                            conscious faith, since the sacraments are, in some sense, converting
                            ordinances and thus means of grace in yet another sense. Cf. Canon
                            George D. Smith, ed., <hi rend="italic">The Teaching of the Catholic
                                Church</hi>, 2 vols. (London, Burns, Oates and Washboume, 1948),
                            II.755-58; but see also Richard P. McBrien, <hi rend="italic">Catholicism</hi> (Minneapolis, Winston Press, 1980),

                    </note> the mere work done, profiteth nothing; that there
                    is no <hi rend="italic">power</hi> to save but in the Spirit of God, no <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> but in the blood of Christ; that consequently even
                    what God ordains conveys no grace to the soul if you trust not in him alone. On
                    the other hand, he that does truly trust in him cannot fall short of the grace
                    of God, even though he were cut off from every outward ordinance, though he were
                    shut up in the centre of the earth.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, in using all means, seek God alone. In and through every outward thing
                    look singly to the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of his Spirit and the <hi rend="italic">merits</hi> of his Son. Beware you do not stick in the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> itself; if you do, it is all lost labour. Nothing
                    short of God can satisfy your soul. Therefore eye him in all, through all, and
                    above all.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn97" n="97">
