                <head><hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment</hi></head>
                <p>With <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, 1-36, the barebones of Wesley’s doctrine of
                    salvation had been exposed and his understanding of the imperatives of grace
                    expounded. The logical next step was a stocktaking of the impact of the
                    Methodist Revival within the Church of England and a positive delineation of the
                    terms for a fruitful coexistence of the Methodists with the ecclesiastical
                    establishment. Nos. 37-39 are designed, at least in part, to aid this process of
                    what Wesley intended as a sort of mutual accommodation.</p>
                <p>Very early on in the Revival the Methodists had been tagged with the label
                    ‘enthusiasts’, which was reason enough for them to be deplored, since to
                    eighteenth-century English ears, ‘enthusiasm’ had long been a near synonym for
                    ‘fanaticism’. Sober men recalled the excesses of Cromwell’s Commonwealth, the
                    disruptive claims of the Quakers, Ranters, and others, to superior illuminations
                    and sanctity. Lord Shaftesbury, in 1711, had included ‘A Letter Concerning
                    Enthusiasm’ in Vol. I of his <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Men, Manners,
                        Opinions, Times</hi>, in which he held up enthusiasms, ancient and modern,
                    to lighthearted contempt. The Methodists, then, were obvious targets for scorn
                    with their claims of assurance and their irregular ways of worship. Their
                    critics varied from moderate and serious men like Josiah Tucker and Joseph Trapp
                    to intemperate pamphleteers such as those listed in Richard Green’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Anti-Methodist Publications</hi>; and, always, the main charge
                    was enthusiasm; cf. Umphrey Lee, <hi rend="italic">Historical Backgrounds of
                        Early Methodist Enthusiasm</hi>, and Ronald A. Knox, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Enthusiasm</hi>, chs. xvii-xxi. Henry Moore, in his <hi rend="italic">Life
                        of John Wesley</hi> (1826), I.464, reports a bitter exchange between Wesley
                    and Joseph Butler (the ablest intellect in the Anglican hierarchy) on August 18,
                    1739, in which Butler had expressed his horror of what he regarded as Wesley’s
                    presumptions: ‘Sir, the pretending to extraordinary revelations, and gifts of
                    the Holy Ghost is a horrid thing—a very horrid thing.’ Shortly, another bishop,
                    Edmund Gibson of London, the Church’s greatest canonist, would be warning his
                    people against Methodist ‘enthusiasm’ (<hi rend="italic">A Pastoral Letter to
                        the People of His Diocese… </hi><pb n="02:045"/>
                    <hi rend="italic">By Way of Caution Against Lukewarmness on the one hand and
                        Enthusiasm on the Other</hi>). In October, the Vicar of Furneaux Pelham, the
                    Revd. Charles Wheatly, an eminent liturgist, would describe the Methodists to
                    his audience in St. Paul’s Cathedral as ‘rapturous enthusiasts’ (<hi
                        rend="italic">St. John’s Test of Knowing Christ… A Sermon…Designed as a
                        Support to Good Christians Against the Discouragements of some New
                        Enthusiasts</hi>). George Whitefield was a more vulnerable target here than
                    Wesley, but they were blurred together in their critics’ minds; and in any case
                    the issue was larger than the individuals involved. Six years and a hundred
                    pamphlets later, the Vicar of Battersea, the Revd. Thomas Church, had published
                    some <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s Last Journal</hi>,
                    in which he anticipated Dr. Johnson’s definition of enthusiasm as ‘a vain
                    confidence of divine favour’ and classified Wesley and his people under this
                    sign (cf. Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Answer to Mr. Church’s Remarks</hi>, also
                    1745). In 1749 an anonymous blast would come from the Bishop of Exeter, George
                    Lavington, <hi rend="italic">The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists
                        Compared</hi>; this lent official sanction to the rumours about some sort of
                    affinity between the Methodist sectaries and the Roman Catholic heretics and
                    traitors.</p>
                <p>Obviously, what the Methodists and others needed rather badly was a calm and
                    constructive restatement of the issue. ‘The Nature of Enthusiasm’ is Wesley’s
                    contribution to this need in these circumstances. There are only two reports of
                    Wesley’s having preached from Acts 26:24 before 1750 (May 30, 1741, and May 1,
                    1747) and there is nothing quite like Wesley’s argument here in his earlier
                    replies to Church, Gibson, and others. He had, however, already formulated his
                    basic definition of enthusiasm, as one may see from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journal</hi> entry for January 17, 1739: ‘I was with two persons who I
                    doubt [i.e., think] are properly <hi rend="italic">enthusiasts</hi>. For, first,
                    they think to attain the end without the means, which is <hi rend="italic"
                        >enthusiasm</hi>, properly so called. Again, they think themselves inspired
                    by God, and are not. But false, imaginary inspiration is <hi rend="italic"
                        >enthusiasm</hi>…. it contradicts the law and the testimony [i.e., the
                    Scriptures].’</p>
                <p>The following sermon is an exercise in irony. Wesley does not propose to
                    rehabilitate the term, nor defend himself. Instead, he chooses to take his
                    critics’ own premise that enthusiasm is ‘<hi rend="italic">false</hi>
                    confidence’ and argue from that to a different conclusion: that the really
                    serious case of false confidence is to be seen in the ‘almost Christian’ who
                    regards himself as something he is not. The ‘men of reason’ had equated
                    enthusiasm and fanaticism; Wesley suggests that the real equation is with <hi
                        rend="italic">nominal </hi><pb n="02:046"/><hi rend="italic"
                        >Christianity</hi>. He goes on to probe more deeply, and includes those
                    charismatics ‘who imagine God dictates the very words they speak, pointing out
                    that “God has given us our own reason for a guide, though never excluding the
                    secret assistance of his Spirit”.’ In this way he seeks to clear himself and his
                    people from a clutter of misunderstandings, to blunt the reckless charges of his
                    detractors, and to provide his readers, then and now, with a useful guide for
                    evaluating their claims as to the inner witness of the Spirit and their own
                    assurance of God’s favour. It makes this sermon an interesting digression in the
                    unfolding exposition of the Wesleyan vision of the <hi rend="italic">ordo
                        salutis</hi> and sets the stage for ‘A Caution against Bigotry’, for a
                    commendation of ‘Catholic Spirit’, and a preparation for the climax of the whole
                    progression: the sermon on <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection</hi>. The
                    sermon was reprinted as a pamphlet in 1755, 1778, and 1789; for its publishing
                    history and a list of variant reading, see Appendix, Vol. 4 of this edn.</p>

            <epigraph>
                <p>Acts 26:24</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italic">And Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside

            <p n="1">1. And so say all the world, the men who know not God, of all that are of
                Paul’s religion, of everyone who is so a follower of him as he was of Christ. It is
                true there is a sort of religion—nay, and it is called Christianity too—which may be
                practised without any such imputation, which is generally allowed to be consistent
                with common sense. That is, a religion of form, a round of outward duties performed
                in a decent, regular manner. You may add orthodoxy thereto, a system of right
                opinions; yea, and some quantity of heathen morality. And yet not many will
                pronounce that ‘much <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> hath made you mad.’<note

                herein. They for once mean what they say. They not only affirm but cordially believe

                case—beyond all dispute ‘much <hi rend="italic">religion</hi> hath made him
                mad.’</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is easy to observe that the determinate thing which the world accounts
                madness is that utter contempt of all temporal things, and steady pursuit of things
                eternal; that divine conviction of things not seen;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn9"

                        ><p rend="footnote text">See Rom. 8:16.</p></note> That is, in truth, the

                like one in his senses. In other things he is a reasonable man: ’tis in these
                instances only his head is touched. It is therefore acknowledged that the madness
                under which he labours is of a particular kind. And accordingly they are accustomed
                to distinguish it by a particular name—<hi rend="italic">enthusiasm</hi>.<note
                    place="foot" xml:id="ftn11" n="11"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. the long entry on

                        Chambers’s denial of the validity of the claims of ‘enthusiasts’ to superior
                        insight by virtue of ‘immediate revelation’. But see also Theophilus Evans,
                            <hi rend="italic">The History of Modern Enthusiasm from the Reformation
                            on to the Present Times</hi> (1st edn., 1752; 2nd edn., 1757), and his

                        ‘Enthusiasm is founded neither on reason nor divine revelation but rises
                        from the conceits of a warmed or overweening brain.’</p></note></p>
            <p n="5">5. A term this which is exceeding frequently used, which is scarce ever out of
                some men’s mouths. And yet it is exceeding rarely understood, even by those who use
                it most. It may be therefore not unacceptable to serious men, to all who desire to
                understand what they speak or hear, if I endeavour to explain the meaning of this
                term, to show what ‘enthusiasm’ is. It may be an encouragement to those who are
                unjustly charged therewith; and may possibly be of use to some who are justly
                charged with it—at <pb n="02:048"/>least to others who might be so were they not

                        Θεῷ and signifies a sort of ‘divine inspiration’ antithetical to φρόνησις
                        (‘rationality’). See also other instances of this usage (and the idea of
                        divine ‘possession’) in classical and patristic Greek in Liddell and Scott,

                endeavoured to derive it from ἐν Θεῷ, ‘in God’, because all enthusiasm has reference
                to him. But this is quite forced, there being small resemblance between the word
                derived and those they strive to derive it from. Others would derive it from ἐν
                θυσίᾳ, ‘in sacrifice’, because many of the enthusiasts of old were affected in the
                most violent manner during the time of sacrifice. Perhaps it is a fictitious word,
                invented from the noise which some of those made who were so affected.</p>

                concerning the meaning than concerning the derivation of it. They therefore adopted
                the Greek word because they did not understand it: they did not translate it into
                their own tongues because they knew not how to translate it, it having been always a
                word of loose, uncertain sense, to which no determinate meaning was affixed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is not therefore at all surprising that it is so variously taken at this
                day, different persons understanding it in different senses quite inconsistent with
                each other. Some take it in a good sense, for a divine impulse or impression
                superior to all the natural faculties, and suspending for the time, either in whole
                or in part, both the reason and the outward senses. In this meaning of the word both
                the prophets of old and the apostles were proper ‘enthusiasts’; being at divers
                times so filled with the Spirit, and so influenced by him who dwelt in their hearts,
                that the exercise of their own reason, their senses, and all their natural
                faculties, being suspended, they were wholly actuated by the power of God, and
                ‘spake’ only ‘as they were moved by the Holy Ghost’.<note place="foot"

                        had spoken positively of enthusiasm as ‘an overpowering impression…made on

                        John Fletcher will remind Richard Hill that ‘the word “enthusiasm” may be

                neither morally good nor evil. Thus they speak of the enthusiasm of the poets, of
                Homer and Virgil in particular. And this a late eminent writer extends so far as to
                assert, there is no man excellent in his profession, whatsoever it be, who has not
                in his temper a strong tincture of enthusiasm.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn15"
                    n="15"><p rend="footnote text">Anthony Ashley Cooper, Third Earl of Shaftesbury.
                        In his <hi rend="italic">Characteristics</hi>, I.3-55, he has a ‘Letter
                        Concerning Enthusiasm’ (Sept. 7, 1707). Shaftesbury distinguishes between
                        ‘enthusiasm’ as self-deception and what he calls ‘a noble enthusiasm’, the
                        inspiration ‘allotted to heroes, statesmen, poets, orators, musicians, and
                        even philosophers’ (pp. 53-54; cf. II.393-94; III.30-37). ‘Inspiration is a

                        a <hi rend="italic">false</hi> one’ (p. 53). But Shaftesbury is opposed to
                        anything like persecution of ‘enthusiasts’ and insists (p. 22) that ‘good
                        humour is not only the best security against <hi rend="italic"
                            >enthusiasm</hi>, but the best foundation of <hi rend="italic"
                            >piety</hi> and <hi rend="italic">true religion</hi>.’ Wesley read this
                        in Oxford in 1730. But he also could have found the same point in Dryden’s
                            <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi> (pref.): ‘Imaging is, in itself, the very
                        height and life of poetry which, by a kind of enthusiasm or extraordinary
                        emotion of the soul, makes it seem to us that we behold those things which
                        the poet [beheld].’</p></note> By enthusiasm these appear to understand an
                uncommon vigour of thought, a peculiar fervour of spirit, a vivacity and strength
                not to be found in common men; elevating the soul to greater and higher things than
                cool reason could have attained.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But neither of these is the sense wherein the word enthusiasm is most
                usually understood. The generality of men, if no farther agreed, at least agree thus
                far concerning it, that it is something evil; and this is plainly the sentiment of
                all those who call the religion of the heart enthusiasm. Accordingly I shall take it
                in the following pages as an evil—a misfortune, if not a fault.<note place="foot"

                and such a disorder as greatly hinders the exercise of reason. Nay, sometimes it
                wholly sets it aside: it not only dims but shuts the eyes of the understanding.<note

                madness rather than of folly, seeing a fool is properly one who draws wrong
                conclusions from right premises, whereas a madman draws right conclusions, but from
                wrong premises. And so does an enthusiast. Suppose his <pb n="02:050"/>premises
                true, and his conclusions would necessarily follow. But here lies his mistake: his
                premises are false. He imagines himself to be what he is not. And therefore, setting
                out wrong, the farther he goes the more he wanders out of the way.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Every enthusiast then is properly a madman. Yet his is not an ordinary,
                but a religious madness. By religious I do not mean that it is any part of religion.
                Quite the reverse: religion is the spirit of a sound mind, and consequently stands
                in direct opposition to madness of every kind.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn18"
                    n="18"><p rend="footnote text">So also Chambers’s <hi rend="italic"
                            >Cyclopaedia</hi>, where it is argued that ‘God, when he makes the

                        state to enable him to judge of his inspirations, whether they be of divine
                        original, or no.’ Cf. Nos. 4, <hi rend="italic">Scriptural

                    n.</p></note> But I mean it has religion for its object; it is conversant about
                religion. And so the enthusiast is generally talking of religion, of God or of the
                things of God; but talking in such a manner that every reasonable Christian may
                discern the disorder of his mind. Enthusiasm in general may then be described in
                some such manner as this: a religious madness arising from some falsely imagined
                influence or inspiration of God; at least from imputing something to God which ought
                not to be imputed to him, or expecting something from God which ought not to be
                expected from him.</p>
            <p n="13">13. There are innumerable sorts of enthusiasm. Those which are most common,
                and for that reason most dangerous, I shall endeavour to reduce under a few general
                heads, that they may be more easily understood and avoided.</p>
            <p>The first sort of enthusiasm which I shall mention is that of those who imagine they
                have the <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> which they have not. Thus some imagine, when
                it is not so, that they have ‘redemption’ through Christ, ‘even the forgiveness of
                    sin’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn19" n="19"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Col.
                        1:14.</p></note> These are usually such as ‘have no root in

                ‘they receive the word with joy.’ And ‘because they have no deepness of earth’, no
                deep work in their heart, therefore the seed ‘immediately springs up’.<note
                    place="foot" xml:id="ftn21" n="21"><p rend="footnote text">Matt. 13:5, 17, 20,
                        etc.</p></note> There is immediately a superficial change which, together
                with that light joy, striking in with the pride of their unbroken heart and with
                their inordinate self-love, easily persuades them they have already ‘tasted the good
                word of God, and the powers of the world to come’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn22"

                enthusiasm; it is a kind of madness, arising from the imagination that they have
                that grace which in truth they have not; so that they only deceive their own souls.
                Madness it may justly be termed, for the reasonings of these poor men are right,
                were their premises good; but as those are a mere creature of their own imagination,
                so all that is built on them falls to the ground. The foundation of all their
                    reveries<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn23" n="23"><p rend="footnote text">The <hi

                        thought’, and quotes Locke: ‘Revery is when ideas float in our mind, without
                        any reflection or regard of the understanding.’</p></note> is this: they
                imagine themselves to have faith in Christ. If they had this they would be ‘kings
                and priests to God’,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn24" n="24"><p rend="footnote text"
                        >Rev. 1:6.</p></note> possessed of ‘a kingdom which cannot be moved’.<note

                behaviour is as wide of truth and soberness as that of the ordinary madman who,
                fancying himself an earthly king, speaks and acts in that character.</p>
            <p n="15">15. There are many other enthusiasts of this sort. Such, for instance, is the
                fiery zealot for religion; or (more probably) for the opinions and modes of worship
                which he dignifies with that name. This man also strongly imagines himself to be a
                believer in Jesus, yea, that he is a champion for the faith which was once delivered
                to the saints.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn26" n="26"><p rend="footnote text">Jude
                        3.</p></note> Accordingly all his conduct is formed upon that vain
                imagination. And allowing his supposition to be just, he would have some tolerable
                plea for his behaviour; whereas now it is evidently the effect of a distempered
                brain, as well as of a distempered heart.</p>
            <p n="16">16. But the most common of all the enthusiasts of this kind are those who
                imagine themselves Christians and are not. These abound not only in all parts of our
                land, but in most parts of the habitable earth. That they are not Christians is
                clear and undeniable, if we believe the oracles of God. For Christians are holy;
                these are unholy. Christians love God; these love the world. Christians are humble;
                these are proud. Christians are gentle; these are passionate. Christians have the
                mind which was in Christ;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn27" n="27"><p
                        rend="footnote text">See Phil. 2:5.</p></note> these are at the utmost
                distance from it. Consequently they are no more Christians than they are archangels.
                Yet they imagine themselves so to be; and they can give several reasons for <pb
                    n="02:052"/>it. For they have been <hi rend="italic">called so</hi> ever since
                they can remember. They were ‘christened’ many years ago. They embrace the
                ‘Christian opinions’ vulgarly termed the Christian or catholic faith. They use the
                ‘Christian modes of worship’, as their fathers did before them. They live what is
                called a good ‘Christian life’, as the rest of their neighbours do. And who shall
                presume to think or say that these men are not Christians? Though without one grain
                of true faith in Christ, or of real, inward holiness! Without ever having tasted the
                love of God, or been ‘made partakers of the Holy Ghost’!<note place="foot"

                grand mistake, you blunder on day by day, speaking and acting under a character
                which does in no wise belong to you. Hence arises that palpable, glaring
                inconsistency that runs through your whole behaviour, which is an awkward mixture of
                real heathenism and imaginary Christianity. Yet still, as you have so vast a
                majority on your side, you will always carry it by mere dint of numbers that you are
                the only men in your senses, and all are lunatics who are not as you are. But this
                alters not the nature of things. In the sight of God and his holy angels—yea, and
                all the children of God upon earth—you are mere madmen, mere enthusiasts all. Are
                you not? Are you not ‘walking in a vain shadow’, a shadow of religion, a shadow of
                happiness? Are you not still ‘disquieting yourselves in vain’?<note place="foot"

                        25th of May, 1708…. Bunhill-fields was sufficiently crowded on the 25th of
                        May, in expectation of such a miraculous sight, as some thousands of people
                        now living may very well remember. But, notwithstanding all the prophecies
                        in his favour, there was no resurrection nor any the least symptom of it’
                        (Theophilus Evans, <hi rend="italic">Enthusiasm</hi>, pp. 105-6); but see
                        also ‘Historical Chronicle’, Jan. 1740, <hi rend="italic">Gent’s Mag.</hi>:
                        ‘At Staines, the wife of one Collet, a tanner, having lain dead three days,
                        just before she was to be nailed up in her coffin, opened her eyes and
                        spoke.’ See also George Hickes, <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of Enthusiasm

                        §12.</p></note> Others have <pb n="02:053"/>undertaken to prophesy, to
                foretell things to come, and that with the utmost certainty and exactness. But a
                little time usually convinces these enthusiasts. When plain facts run counter to
                their predictions, experience performs what reason could not, and sinks them down
                into their senses.</p>
            <p n="19">19. To the same class belong those who in preaching or prayer imagine
                themselves to be so influenced by the Spirit of God as in fact they are not. I am
                sensible indeed that without him we can do nothing,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn32"
                    n="32"><p rend="footnote text">See John 15:5.</p></note> more especially in our
                public ministry; that all our preaching is utterly vain unless it be attended with
                his power, and all our prayer, unless his Spirit therein help our infirmities. I
                know if we do not both preach and pray by the Spirit it is all but lost labour,
                seeing the help that is done upon earth, he doth it himself,<note place="foot"
                    xml:id="ftn33" n="33"><p rend="footnote text">Ps. 74:13 (BCP).</p></note> who

                        >1 Cor. 12:6.</p></note> But this does not affect the case before us. Though
                there is a real influence of the Spirit of God, there is also an imaginary one; and
                many there are who mistake the one for the other. Many suppose themselves to be
                under that influence when they are not, when it is far from them. And many others
                suppose they are more under that influence than they really are. Of this number, I
                fear, are all they who imagine that God dictates the very words they speak, and that
                consequently it is impossible they should speak anything amiss, either as to the
                matter or manner of it. It is well known how many enthusiasts of this sort also have
                appeared during the present century; some of whom speak in a far more authoritative
                manner than either St. Paul or any of the apostles.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn35"

            <p n="20">20. The same sort of enthusiasm, though in a lower degree, is frequently found
                in men of a private character. They may likewise imagine themselves to be influenced
                or directed by the Spirit when they are not. I allow, ‘if any man have not the
                Spirit of <pb n="02:054"/>Christ, he is none of his;’<note place="foot"
                    xml:id="ftn36" n="36"><p rend="footnote text">Rom. 8:9.</p></note> and that if
                ever we either think, speak, or act aright, it is through the assistance of that
                blessed Spirit. But how many impute things to him, or expect things from him,
                without any rational or scriptural ground! Such are they who imagine they either do
                or shall receive ‘particular directions’ from God, not only in points of importance,
                but in things of no moment, in the most trifling circumstances of life. Whereas in
                these cases God has given us our own reason for a guide; though never excluding the
                ‘secret assistance’ of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="21">21. To this kind of enthusiasm they are peculiarly exposed who expected to be
                directed of God, either in spiritual things or in common life, in what is justly
                called an <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> manner. I mean by visions or dreams,
                by strong impressions or sudden impulses on the mind. I do not deny that God has of
                old times manifested his will in this manner, or that he can do so now. Nay, I
                believe he does, in some very rare instances. But how frequently do men mistake
                herein! How are they misled by pride and a warm imagination to ascribe such impulses
                or impressions, dreams or visions, to God, as are utterly unworthy of him! Now this
                is all pure enthusiasm, all as wide of religion as it is of truth and soberness.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Perhaps some may ask, ‘Ought we not then to inquire what is <hi
                    rend="italic">the will of God</hi> in all things? And ought not his will to be
                the rule of our practice?’ Unquestionably it ought. But how is a sober Christian to
                make this inquiry? To know what is ‘the will of God’? Not by waiting for
                supernatural dreams. Not by expecting God to reveal it in visions. Not by looking
                for any ‘particular impressions’, or sudden impulses on his mind. No; but by
                consulting the oracles of God. ‘To the law and to the testimony.’<note place="foot"

                particular case? The thing proposed is in itself of an indifferent nature, and so
                left undetermined in Scripture.’ I answer, the Scripture itself gives you a general
                rule, applicable to all particular cases: ‘The will of God is our
                    sanctification.’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn39" n="39"><p rend="footnote text"
                        >Cf. 1 Thess. 4:3.</p></note> It is his will that we should be inwardly and

                    good</hi> in every kind, and in the highest degree whereof we are capable. Thus
                far we tread upon firm ground. This is as clear as the shining of the sun. In order
                therefore to know what is the will of God in a particular case we have only to apply
                this general rule.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Suppose, for instance, it were proposed to a reasonable man to marry, or
                to enter into a new business. In order to know whether this is the will of God,
                being assured, ‘It is the will of God concerning me that I should be as holy and do
                as much good as I can,’ he has only to inquire, ‘In which of these states can I be
                most holy, and do the most good?’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn40" n="40"><p
                        rend="footnote text">This had been Wesley’s rationale for refusing to move
                        from Oxford to Epworth, despite his family’s pleadings; cf. his letter to
                        his father, Dec. 10, 1734, espec. §§4-6, 16.</p></note> And this is to be
                determined partly by reason and partly by experience. Experience tells him what
                advantages he has in his present state, either for being or doing good; and reason
                is to show what he certainly or probably will have in the state proposed. By
                comparing these he is to judge which of the two may most conduce to his being and
                doing good; and as far as he knows this, so far he is certain what is the will of
                God.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Meantime the assistance of his Spirit is supposed during the whole process
                of the inquiry. Indeed ’tis not easy to say in how many ways that assistance is
                conveyed. He may bring many circumstances to our remembrance; may place others in a
                stronger and clearer light; may insensibly open our mind to receive conviction, and
                fix that conviction upon our heart. And to a concurrence of many circumstances of
                this kind in favour of what is acceptable in his sight he may superadd such an
                unutterable peace of mind, and so uncommon a measure of his love, as will leave us
                no possibility of doubting that <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, even <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi>, is his will concerning us.</p>
            <p n="26">26. This is the plain, scriptural, rational way to know what is the will of
                God in a particular case. But considering how seldom this way is taken, and what a
                flood of enthusiasm must needs break in on those who endeavour to know the will of
                God by unscriptural, irrational ways, it were to be wished that the expression
                itself were far more sparingly used. The using it as some do, on the most trivial
                occasions, is a plain breach of the third commandment. It is a gross way of taking
                the name of God in vain, and betrays great irreverence toward him. Would it not be
                far better then to use <pb n="02:056"/>other expressions, which are not liable to
                such objections? For example: instead of saying on any particular occasion, ‘I want
                to know what is the will of God,’ would it not be better to say, ‘I want to know
                what will be most for my improvement, and what will make me most useful.’ This way
                of speaking is clear and unexceptionable. It is putting the matter on a plain,
                scriptural issue, and that without any danger of enthusiasm.</p>
            <p n="27">27. A third very common sort of enthusiasm (if it does not coincide with the
                former) is that of those who think to attain the end without using the means, by the
                immediate power of God. If indeed those means were providentially withheld they
                would not fall under this charge. God can, and sometimes does in cases of this
                nature, exert his own immediate power. But they who expect this when they have those
                means and will not use them are proper enthusiasts. Such are they who expect to
                understand the Holy Scriptures without reading them and meditating thereon; yea,
                without using all such helps as are in their power, and may probably conduce to that
                end. Such are they who <hi rend="italic">designedly</hi> speak in the public
                assembly without any premeditation. I say ‘designedly’, because there may be such
                circumstances as at some times make it unavoidable. But whoever <hi rend="italic"
                    >despises</hi> that great means of speaking profitably is so far an
                enthusiast.</p>
            <p n="28">28. It may be expected that I should mention what some have accounted a fourth
                sort of enthusiasm, namely, the imagining those things to be owing to the providence
                of God which are not owing thereto. But I doubt. I know not what things they are
                which are not owing to the providence of God; in ordering, or at least in governing,
                of which this is not either directly or remotely concerned. I expect nothing but
                sin; and even in the sins of others I see the providence of God to <hi rend="italic"
                    >me</hi>. I do not say, his <hi rend="italic">general providence</hi>, for this
                I take to be a sounding word which means just nothing.<note place="foot"

                imputes anything which befalls him to providence does not therein make himself any
                more the favourite of heaven than he supposes every man under heaven to be?

                diligence, considering the dreadful effects it has so often produced, and which
                indeed naturally result from it. Its immediate offspring is pride; it continually
                increases this source from whence it flows, and hereby it alienates us more and more
                from the favour and from the life of God. It dries up the very springs of faith and
                love, of righteousness and true holiness;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn46" n="46"><p
                        rend="footnote text">Eph. 4:24.</p></note> seeing all these flow from grace.

            <p n="31">31. Together with pride there will naturally arise an unadvisable and
                unconvincible spirit; so that into whatever error or fault the enthusiast falls
                there is small hope of his recovery. For reason will have little weight with him (as
                has been justly and frequently observed) who imagines he is led by an higher guide,
                by the immediate wisdom of God. And as he grows in pride, so he must grow in
                unadvisableness, and in stubbornness also. He must be less and less capable of being
                convinced, less susceptible of persuasion; more and more attached to his own
                judgment and his own will, till he is altogether fixed and immovable.</p>

                what, not to use the word till you understand it. As in all other points, so
                likewise in this, learn to think before you speak. First, know the meaning of this
                hard word; and then use it if need require.</p>
            <p n="34">34. But if so few, even among men of education and learning, much more among
                the common sort of men, understand this dark, ambiguous word, or have any fixed
                notion of what it means, then, secondly, beware of judging or calling any man an
                enthusiast upon common report. This is by no means a sufficient ground for giving
                any name of reproach to any man; least of all is it a sufficient ground for so black
                a term of reproach as this. The more evil it contains, the more cautious you should
                be how you apply it to anyone; to bring so heavy an accusation without full proof
                being neither consistent with justice nor mercy.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But if enthusiasm be so great an evil, beware you are not entangled
                therewith yourself. Watch and pray that you fall not into the temptation.<note

                have those <hi rend="italic">gifts</hi> from God which you have not. Trust not in
                visions or dreams, in sudden impressions or strong impulses of any kind. Remember,
                it is not by these you are to know what is ‘the will of God’ on any particular
                occasion, but by applying the plain Scripture rule, with the help of experience and
                reason, and the ordinary assistance of the Spirit of God. Do not lightly take the
                name of God in your mouth: do not talk of ‘the will of God’ on every trifling
                occasion. But let your words as well as your actions be all tempered with reverence
                and godly fear.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Beware, lastly, of imagining you shall obtain the end without using the
                means conducive to it. God <hi rend="italic">can</hi> give the end without any means
                at all; but you have no reason to think he <hi rend="italic">will</hi>. Therefore
                constantly and carefully use all these means which he has appointed to be the
                ordinary channels of his grace. Use every <pb n="02:060"/>means which either reason
                or Scripture recommends as conducive (through the free love of God in Christ) either
                to the obtaining or increasing any of the gifts of God. Thus expect a daily growth
                in that pure and holy religion which the world always did, and always will, call
                enthusiasm; but which to all who are saved from real enthusiasm—from merely nominal
