                <head>
                    <hi rend="italic">An Introductory Comment [to Sermons 21-33]</hi>
                </head>
                <p>The unifying theme of these next thirteen ‘discourses’ on the Sermon on the
                    Mount, with all their variations and nuancings, is the Christian life understood
                    as the fruit of justifying faith. But given such faith, what follows? Wesley’s
                    answer is given in this extended exposition of the Christian life based on the
                        <hi rend="italic">locus classicus</hi> of evangelical ethics, ‘The Sermon on
                    the Mount’ (i.e., Matthew 5-7). Since Tyndale, this ‘sermon’ had been understood
                    as ‘the epitome of God’s laws and promises’ for Christian believers; cf.
                    Clebsch, <hi rend="italic">England’s Earliest Protestants</hi>, p. 184; see also
                    William Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Expository Notes…on the New Testament</hi>
                    (eleven editions between 1700 and 1739), Preface to chapter 5: ‘Christ’s famous
                    Sermon on the Mount comprehends the sum and substance of both the Old and New
                    Testaments.’</p>
                <p>Taken together, the following sermons are not a thirteen-part essay, tightly
                    organized and argued. Instead, they are separate sermons, drawn from materials
                    running back to 1725, arranged in a triadic pattern that seems to have been
                    original with Wesley. Each is a discourse in its own right; yet the series is
                    designed so that each appears as a part of a whole. This means that the sermons
                    may be read singly or together, but with an eye on their shared aim: ‘to assert
                    and prove every branch of <hi rend="italic">gospel obedience</hi> as
                    indispensably necessary to eternal salvation’; cf. Wesley’s open letter (Nov.
                    17, 1759) to John Downes in reply to the latter’s abusive <hi rend="italic">Methodism Examined and Exposed</hi> (1759).</p>
                <p>Many of the great and near-great commentators of the seventeenth and eighteenth
                    centuries had devoted their talents to the interpretation of Matthew 5-7 as the
                    principal summary of Christian ethics, or, in Henry Hammond’s phrase, as ‘an
                    abstract of Christian philosophy’; cf. his <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Catechism</hi> (1st edn., <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1644), II.1, in the <hi rend="italic">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</hi> (1847), p. 83. Chief
                    among these earlier works, in the order of their influences upon Wesley’s
                    thought, were Bishop Offspring Blackall, ‘Eighty-Seven Practical Discourses Upon
                    Our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, I.1-561;
                    II.609-939; <pb n="467"/>John Norris, <hi rend="italic">Practical
                        Discourses</hi>; the American, James Blair, <hi rend="italic">Our Saviour’s
                        Divine Sermon on the Mount in IV Volumes</hi> (1722; 2nd edn., 1740, with a
                    preface by Daniel Waterland); John Cardinal Bona, <hi rend="italic">Guide to
                        Eternity…</hi> (six editions in English between 1672 and 1712); and Henry
                    Hammond, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> Echoes of all these are scattered along
                    the way, together with lesser borrowings from Bengel, Poole, and Henry. This
                    makes it all the more remarkable that Wesley came up with a model of his own,
                    both inform and substance. This series thus reminds us, yet again, of Wesley’s
                    ready appeal to tradition—even while he maintains his own originality and
                    independence.</p>
                <p>Benjamin Ingham records in his Journal that ‘during the voyage [to Georgia]
                    Wesley went over our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount’ with the ship’s company
                    aboard the <hi rend="italic">Simmonds</hi>. There are also other records of his
                    preaching, very early on, from one or another text in Matthew 5-7. For example,
                    his second sermon was preached at Binsey (near Oxford), November 21, 1725, on
                    Matt. 6:33. A first draft of the sermon which appears here as ‘Discourse VIII’
                    seems to have been written out in 1736. Later, it was the example of the Sermon
                    on the Mount that encouraged Wesley to break out of his High Church prejudices
                    in Bristol, April 1, 1739: ‘In the evening (Mr. Whitefield being gone) I begun
                    expounding our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount (one pretty remarkable precedent of
                        <hi rend="italic">field preaching</hi>, though I suppose <hi rend="italic">there were churches</hi> at that time also) to a little society which was
                    accustomed to meet once or twice a week in Nicholas Street;’ cf. <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries for this whole story of the unplanned
                    outbreak of the Wesleyan Revival.</p>
                <p>The records show that, between 1739 and 1746, Wesley preached more than one
                    hundred sermons from separate texts in the Sermon on the Mount. There is,
                    however, no recorded instance of his having treated that Sermon as a whole
                    anywhere else. Evidently, he was prepared to allow this series, once published,
                    to stand as his sufficient comment on the subject.</p>
                <p>In his introduction to ‘Discourse X’, §§1-3, Wesley repeats his explanation (cf.
                    ‘Discourse I’, Proem, §10) of how he had conceived the design of Matthew 5-7,
                    according to its three unfolding themes: (1) ‘the sum of true religion’; (2)
                    ‘rules touching that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward
                    actions’; and (3) ‘the main hindrances of this religion’. He then adds a
                    clarifying summary: ‘In the fifth chapter [of St. Matthew] our great Teacher…has
                    laid before us those <hi rend="italic">dispositions of the soul</hi> which
                    constitute real Christianity…. In the sixth [chapter] he has shown how all our
                        <hi rend="italic">actions</hi>…may be made holy, and good, and acceptable to
                    God, by a pure and holy intention…. In <pb n="468"/>the former part of [ch. 7]
                    he points out the most common and fatal hindrances of this holiness; in the
                    latter [part] he exhorts us, by various motives, to break through all [such
                    hindrances] and secure that prize of our high calling [of God in Christ Jesus]’
                    (cf. Phil. 3:14).</p>
                <p>The thirteen discourses are divided almost equally over the three chapters of St.
                    Matthew: five for chapter five, four each for six and seven. Of the first five,
                    Discourse I is devoted to the first two Beatitudes; Discourse II to Beatitudes
                    three through five (with a hymn to love based on 1 Cor. 13); Discourse III to
                    the remainder of the Beatitudes; Discourse IV turns to Christianity as ‘a social
                    religion’ in which inward holiness (our love of God) prompts outward holiness
                    (love of neighbour); Discourse V is a balancing of law <hi rend="italic">and</hi> gospel. Discourses VI-IX are based on chapter six: VI to the
                    problems of purity and holiness of intention (to the ‘works of piety and of
                    mercy’); VII to fasting; VIII to a denunciation of greed and surplus
                    accumulation; IX to the mutually exclusive services of God and Mammon.
                    Discourses X-XIII turn to various hindrances to holy living and to their
                    avoidance: X to ‘judging’ (contrary to love), ‘intemperate zeal’, ‘neglect of
                    prayer’, ‘neglect of charity’; XI to the noxious influences of ill-example and
                    ill-advice with which the world deludes us; XII to false prophets and unedifying
                    preachers (and yet also our duties to attend church nonetheless and to avail
                    ourselves of all means of grace); XIII is an inevitable comment on the parable
                    of the houses built on sand and rock. Discourse XII was also published
                    separately in the same year that it appeared in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi>, III
                    (1750), under the title, ‘A Caution Against False Prophets. A Sermon on Matt.
                    vii. 15-20. Particularly recommended to the People Called Methodists’. This went
                    through seven editions during Wesley’s lifetime. For a stemma delineating the
                    publishing history of that sermon (‘collected’ and ‘separate’) and a list of
                    variant readings, see Appendix, ‘Wesley’s Text’, Vol. IV, see also <hi rend="italic">Bibliog</hi>, Nos. 130 and 13o.i.</p>
                <p>Obviously there is no interest, in any of these sermons, in critical textual
                    problems or in the historical context. Everywhere it is assumed that in St.
                    Matthew’s text we are dealing with divine <hi rend="italic">ipsissima
                    verba</hi>—i.e., with a direct address from ὁ ὤν, ‘the self-existent, the
                    Supreme, the God who is over all, blessed for ever’ (§9 below). The Sermon on
                    the Mount, in Wesley’s view, is the only Gospel passage where Christ designed
                    ‘to lay down at once the whole plan of his religion, to give us a full prospect
                    of Christianity’. What matters most in our reading, therefore, is an awareness
                    of Wesley’s sense of the wholeness of the message he is interpreting, of his
                    conviction of the honest integration of an evangel profoundly ethical with an
                    ethic that is also vividly <pb n="469"/>evangelical. Maybe more than anywhere
                    else in <hi rend="italic">SOSO</hi> this particular bloc displays Wesley’s
                    distinctive concern for integration and balance—between the faith that justifies
                    and the faith that works by love.</p>

                    eye which God hath opened, every enlightened understanding. The ornament of a
                    meek, humble, loving spirit will at least excite the approbation of all those
                    who are capable in any degree of discerning spiritual good and evil. From the
                    hour men begin to emerge out of the darkness which covers the giddy, unthinking
                    world, they cannot but perceive how desirable a thing it is to be thus
                    transformed into the likeness of him that created us. This inward religion bears
                    the shape of God so visibly impressed upon it that a soul must be wholly
                    immersed in flesh and blood when he can doubt of its divine original. We may say
                    of this, in a secondary sense, even as of the Son of God himself, that it is
                    ‘the brightness of his glory, the express image of his person’: ἀπαύγασμα τῆς
                    δόξης […] αὐτοῦ, ‘the beaming forth of his’ eternal ‘glory’; and yet so tempered
                    and softened that even the children of men may herein see God and live: χαρακτὴρ
                    τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ, ‘the character, the stamp, the living impression, of his
                        <pb n="532"/>person’ who is the fountain of beauty and love, the original
                    source of all excellency and perfection.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">

                            than Blackall, or any of the other commentators on the Sermon on the

                    practical application.</p>

            <div type="section" n="1">
                <p n="1">I. 1. First, I shall endeavour to show that Christianity is essentially a
                    social religion, and that to turn it into a solitary religion is indeed to
                    destroy it.</p>
                <p>By Christianity I mean that method of worshipping God which is here revealed to
                    man by Jesus Christ. When I say this is essentially a social religion, I mean
                    not only that it cannot subsist so well, but that it cannot subsist at all
                    without society, without <pb n="534"/>living and conversing with other men. And
                    in showing this I shall confine myself to those considerations which will arise
                    from the very discourse before us. But if this be shown, then doubtless to turn
                    this religion into a solitary one is to destroy it.</p>
                <p>Not that we can in any wise condemn the intermixing solitude or retirement with
                    society. This is not only allowable but expedient; nay, it is necessary, as
                    daily experience shows, for everyone that either already is or desires to be a
                    real Christian. It can hardly be that we should spend one entire day in a
                    continued intercourse with men without suffering loss in our soul, and in some
                    measure grieving the Holy Spirit of God. We have need daily to retire from the
                    world, at least morning and evening, to converse with God, to commune more
                    freely with our Father which is in secret.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn13" n="13">
                        <p rend="footnote text">Matt. 6:6, 18.</p>
                    </note> Nor indeed can a
                    man of experience condemn even longer seasons of religious retirement, so they
                    do not imply any neglect of the worldly employ wherein the providence of God has
                    placed us.</p>
                <p n="2">2. Yet such retirement must not swallow up all our time; this would be to
                    destroy, not advance, true religion. For that the religion described by our Lord
                    in the foregoing words cannot subsist without society, without our living and
                    conversing with other men, is manifest from hence, that several of the most
                    essential branches thereof can have no place if we have no intercourse with the
                    world.</p>
                <p n="3">3. There is no disposition, for instance, which is more essential to
                    Christianity than meekness. Now although this, as it implies resignation to God,
                    or patience in pain and sickness, may subsist in a desert, in a hermit’s cell,
                    in total solitude; yet as it implies (which it no less necessarily does)
                    mildness, gentleness, and long-suffering, it cannot possibly have a being, it
                    has no place under heaven, without an intercourse with other men. So that to
                    attempt turning this into a solitary virtue is to destroy it from the face of
                    the earth.</p>
                <p n="4">4. Another necessary branch of true Christianity is peacemaking, or doing
                    of good. That this is equally essential with any of the other parts of the
                    religion of Jesus Christ there can be no stronger argument to evince (and
                    therefore it would be absurd to allege any other) than that it is here inserted
                    in the original plan he has laid down of the fundamentals of his religion.
                    Therefore to set aside <pb n="535"/>this is the same daring insult on the
                    authority of our great Master as to set aside mercifulness, purity of heart, or
                    any other branch of his institution. But this is apparently set aside by all who
                    call us to the wilderness, who recommend entire solitude either to the babes, or
                    the young men, or the fathers in Christ.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn14" n="14">

                    man—that is, one that takes every opportunity of doing all good to all men? What
                    can be more plain than that this fundamental branch of the religion of Jesus
                    Christ cannot possibly subsist without society, without our living and
                    conversing with other men?</p>

                    or intercourse with men of the opposite character? Men who do not obey, perhaps
                    do not believe, the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ? The advice of St. Paul to
                    the Christians at Corinth may seem to favour this: ‘I wrote unto you in an
                    epistle not to company with fornicators.’<hi rend="endnote_reference">

                    God that every Christian should be in an open point of view; that he may give

                <p>I answer, it is most true that the root of religion lies in the heart, in the
                    inmost soul; that this is the union of the soul with God, the life of God in the
                    soul of man. But if this root be really in the heart it cannot but put forth
                    branches. And these are the several <pb n="542"/>instances of outward obedience,
                    which partake of the same nature with the root, and consequently are not only
                    marks or signs, but substantial parts of religion.</p>
                <p>It is also true that bare, outside religion, which has no root in the heart, is
                    nothing worth; that God delighteth not in such outward services, no more than in
                    Jewish burnt offerings, and that a pure and holy heart is a sacrifice with which
                    he is always well pleased. But he is also well pleased with all that outward
                    service which arises from the heart; with the sacrifice of our prayers (whether
                    public or private), of our praises and thanksgivings; with the sacrifice of our
                    goods, humbly devoted to him, and employed wholly to his glory; and with that of
                    our bodies, which he peculiarly claims; which the Apostle ‘beseeches us, by the
                    mercies of God, to present unto him, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to
