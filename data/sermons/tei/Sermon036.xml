                <p>The most patent danger in Wesley’s delicate balancing of faith alone and holy
                    living was its possible tilt toward moralism (‘<hi rend="italic">inherent</hi>
                    righteousness’); something of this sort did eventually occur in Methodism after
                    Wesley’s death, despite all his earnest efforts to safeguard his gospel against
                    it. But the opposite extreme, antinomianism, was already a clear and present
                    danger among the Methodists; several versions of it were even then being
                    vigorously asserted, as if antinomianism were a valid consequence of ‘faith
                    alone’. This controversy had emerged with the Revival itself, in Wesley’s
                    disagreements with the Moravians (cf. JWJ, November 1, 1739, April 19-26, 1740).
                    It had been carried forward by the reckless rhetoric of men like William
                    Cudworth, minister of the Grey Eagle Street Church in London, although Wesley
                    had found its substance in the more sophisticated teachings of James Hervey and
                    others.</p>
                <p>In 1741 (September 3) Wesley had debated the issue of faith and good works with
                    Count von Zinzendorf in London. Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> record
                    of this passage at arms, along with his earlier denunciations of Whitefield’s
                    ‘Calvinism ’, etc., had drawn fire from the antinomians (and from some
                    Calvinists). In 1745, Cudworth had published a twenty-five page <hi
                        rend="italic">Dialogue Between a Preacher of God’s Righteousness and a
                        Preacher of Inherent Righteousness</hi>, in which he spoke ‘for God’ and
                    allowed Wesley to speak for ‘inherent righteousness’; cf. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Christ Alone Exalted</hi> (1747), in which Cudworth’s tract is No. VIII.
                    The urgency of this is evident from the manuscript Minutes of the second Annual
                    Conference in Bristol, August 2,1745, in Questions 24-26 and their answers:</p>

                <quote>A. (1). In exalting the merits and love of Christ.</quote>
                <quote>(2). In rejoicing evermore.</quote>
                <quote>><pb n="02:002"/>Q. 25. What can we do to stop the progress of
                    antinomianism?</quote>
                <quote>A. (1). Pray without ceasing that God would speak for himself.</quote>
                <quote>(2). Write one or two more dialogues.</quote>
                <quote>Q. 26. Doth faith supersede (set aside the necessity of holiness or good
                    works?</quote>
                <quote>A. <hi rend="italic">In no wise. So far from it that it implies both, as a
                        cause doth its effects.</hi></quote>
                <p>The proposed ‘one or two more dialogues’ promptly appeared in the same year: <hi
                        rend="italic">A Dialogue between an Antinomian and his Friend</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">A Second Dialogue between an Antinomian and his Friend</hi>.
                    The first dialogue was a sort of reenactment of the 1741 debate with Zinzendorf,
                    with Zinzendorf’s original words now translated from the Latin and with Wesley’s
                    original replies revised. The second pamphlet was Wesley’s rejoinder to
                    Cudworth’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogue</hi>; it concludes with what was intended
                    to be a recapitulation of the discussion as a whole. Unsurprisingly, though,
                    these dialogues had not concluded the affair, as we see from many <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal</hi> entries over the ensuing five years (see
                    especially October 30 and December 11, 1749, etc.). It was, therefore, both
                    urgent and appropriate for Wesley to follow his thirteen sermons on the Sermon
                    on the Mount with three additional sermonic essays on the complex, dynamic
                    interdependence of ‘Law and Gospel’ in his doctrine of salvation. This was the
                    aim and occasion of the following sermons.</p>
                <p>Despite their complex development, the sermon outlines are plain and simple. The
                    ‘original’ of the Law is man’s inborn moral sense—not ‘natural’ in the deist
                    sense but, rather, as an aspect of the residual <hi rend="italic">imago
                    Dei</hi>. The ‘nature’ of the Law is <hi rend="italic">Christological</hi>, as
                    if Torah and Christ are in some sense to be equated. The ‘properties’ of the Law
                    are threefold, and here Wesley follows the standard Puritan exegesis of Rom.
                    7:12 as to the Law’s holiness and its instrumentality in the delineation of the
                    just and the good. Incidentally, seven of the eight contemporary editions of
                    this sermon here read ‘properties’, in the plural; only the text of <hi
                        rend="italic">Works</hi> (1771) has ‘property’ (but both Jackson and Sugden
                    seem to have preferred the singular). Wesley’s brief discussion of the ‘uses of
                    the Law’ ignores the fact of the extended debate over ‘the <hi rend="italic"
                        >third</hi> use of the Law’ between the Lutherans and the Calvinists, and
                    obscures the further fact that Wesley has come down squarely on the Puritan side
                    of the argument: the threefold ‘use’ of the Law is to convict, convert, <hi
                        rend="italic">and sustain the believer</hi>—in and after justification (see
                    below, No. 34, IV.1 and n.).</p>
                <p><pb n="02:003"/>The twin discourses entitled ‘The Law Established through Faith’
                    amount to a single essay in two parts. In the first, Wesley turns on his critics
                    and charges them with ‘voiding the Law’ by (1) ‘not preaching it at all’, and
                    (2) by preaching ‘faith’ so as to ‘supersede the necessity of holiness’. In the
                    second part, he argues that the Law is and ought to be ‘established <hi
                        rend="italic">by faith</hi>’: (1) by a doctrine in which salvation by faith
                    is understood as the foundation on which the whole enterprise of Christian
                    living must rest; (2) by preaching ‘faith alone’ so as to promote ‘holiness’
                    rather than to supersede or subordinate it; and (3) by the manifestation of holy
                    living in Christian hearts and lives.</p>
                <p>What we have here, then, is a further variation on the central theme of the
                    preceding thirteen sermons: the distinctive character of evangelical ethics in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">fides caritate formata</hi> is always the consequent
                    of the <hi rend="italic">sola fide</hi>, never its alternative. They also have
                    in them (Discourse II, II.1-6) one of Wesley’s most interesting and original
                    proposals: that ‘faith is in order to love’ and, therefore, that ‘love will
                    exist after faith’—which may or may not be an amendment of 1 Cor. 13:13; cf.
                    Wesley’s <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> on this verse: ‘Faith, hope, and love are
                    the sum of perfection on earth; love alone is the sum of perfection in
                    heaven.’</p>
                <p>These sermons were ‘tracts for the times’ and not the distillate of oral
                    preaching. This appears from the fact that we have no record of Wesley’s having
                    preached on Rom. 7:12, ever, and there are only two clear references to his use
                    of Rom. 3:31 (June 27 and August 2, 1741). A possible third reference may be in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry for April 25, 1745: ‘I preached at
                    Little Horton and Bradford.’ Here I ‘could not but observe how God has made void
                    all their labour who “make void the law through faith”.’ More than likely,
                    though, this is either a comment on a local circumstance or, at most, one of the
                    ‘heads’ in a sermon with another, unspecified text. For a publishing history of
                    Nos. 34-36 and a list of variant readings in their successive texts, see

            <div type="introduction">
                <p n="1">1. It has been shown in the preceding discourse which are the most usual
                    ways of ‘making void the law through faith’. Namely, first, the not preaching it
                    at all, which effectually makes it all void at a stroke, and this under colour
                    of ‘preaching Christ’ and magnifying the gospel—though it be, in truth,
                    destroying both the one and the other. Secondly, the teaching (whether directly
                    or indirectly) that faith supersedes the necessity of holiness, that this is
                    less necessary now, or a less degree of it necessary, than before Christ came;
                    that it is less necessary to us because we believe than otherwise it would have
                    been; or that Christian liberty is a liberty from any kind or degree of
                    holiness—so perverting those great truths that we are now under the <hi
                        rend="italic">covenant of grace</hi> and not of <hi rend="italic"
                    >works</hi>; that ‘a man is justified by faith, without the works of the
                        law’;<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Rom.
                            3:28.</p></note> and that ‘to him that worketh not, but believeth, his
                    faith is counted for righteousness’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Rom. 4:5.</p></note> Or, thirdly, the doing this
                    practically: the making void the law in practice though not in principle; the
                    living or acting as if faith was designed to excuse us from holiness; the
                    allowing ourselves in sin ‘because we are not under the law, but under
                        grace’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3"><p rend="footnote text">Rom.
                            6:15.</p></note> It remains to inquire how we may follow a better
                    pattern, how we may be able to say with the Apostle, ‘Do we then make void the
                    law through faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the law.’</p>
                <p n="2">2. We do not indeed establish the old ceremonial law: we know that is
                    abolished for ever. Much less do we establish the whole Mosaic
                    dispensation—this, we know, our Lord has ‘nailed to his <pb n="02:034"
                        />cross’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4"><p rend="footnote text">Cf.
                            Col. 2:14.</p></note> Nor yet do we so establish the moral law (which,
                    it is to be feared, too many do) as if the fulfilling it, the keeping all the
                    commandments, were the condition of our justification. If it were so, surely ‘in
                    his sight should no man living be justified’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn5"
                        n="5"><p rend="footnote text">Cf. Rom. 3:20.</p></note> But all this being
                    allowed, we still, in the Apostle’s sense, ‘establish the law’, the moral
                    law.</p>

            <div type="section" n="1">
                <p n="1">I. 1. We ‘establish the law’, first, by our doctrine: by endeavouring to
                    preach it in its whole extent, to explain and enforce every part of it in the
                    same manner as our great Teacher did while upon earth. We establish it by
                    following St Peter’s advice, ‘If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of
                        God;’<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn6" n="6"><p rend="footnote text">1 Pet.
                            4:11.</p></note> as the holy men of old, moved by the Holy Ghost, spoke
                    and wrote for our instruction; and as the apostles of our blessed Lord, by the
                    direction of the same Spirit. We establish it whenever we speak in his name, by
                    keeping back nothing from them that hear; by declaring to them without any
                    limitation or reserve the whole counsel of God. And in order the more
                    effectually to establish it we use herein great plainness of speech. ‘We are not
                    as many that corrupt the word of God’, καπηλεύουσι<note place="foot"
                        xml:id="ftn7" n="7"><p rend="footnote text">An odd corruption of 2 Cor. 2:17
                            (καπηλεύοντες), which Wesley has changed from St Paul’s graceful

                    there was for love. Love existed from eternity, in God, the great ocean of love.

                    religious intuition. See No. 128, ‘The Deceitfulness of the Human Heart’, II.8,
                    where Wesley quotes from another verse of this same poem.</p>
                <p>He was then able to talk with him face to face, whose face we cannot now see and
                    live; and consequently had no need of that faith whose office it is to supply
                    the want of sight.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn52" n="52"><p
                            rend="footnote text">Cf. No. 10, ‘The Witness of the Spirit, I’, I.12

                <p n="5">5. On the other hand, it is absolutely certain, faith, in its particular
                    sense, had then no place. For in that sense it necessarily presupposes sin, and
                    the wrath of God declared against the sinner; without which there is no need of
                    an atonement for sin in order to the sinner’s reconciliation with God.
                    Consequently, as there was no need of an atonement before the fall, so there was
                    no place for faith in that atonement; man being then pure from every stain of
                    sin, holy as God is holy. But love even then filled his heart. It reigned in him
                    without a rival. And it was only when love was lost by sin that faith was added,
                    not for its own sake, nor with any design that it should exist any longer than
                    until it had answered the end for which it was ordained—namely, to restore man
                    to the love from which he was fallen. At the fall therefore was added this
                    evidence of things unseen,<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn53" n="53"><p
                            rend="footnote text">See Heb. 11:1.</p></note> which before was utterly
                    needless; this confidence in redeeming love, which could not possibly have any
                    place till the promise was made that the seed of the woman should bruise the
                    serpent’s head.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn54" n="54"><p rend="footnote text"

                <p n="6">6. Faith then was originally designed of God to re-establish the law of
                    love. Therefore, in speaking thus, we are not undervaluing it, or robbing it of
                    its due praise, but on the contrary showing its real worth, exalting it in its
                    just proportion, and giving it that very place which the wisdom of God assigned
                    it from the beginning. It is the grand means of restoring that holy love wherein
                    man was originally created. It follows, that although faith is of no value in
                        <pb n="02:041"/>itself (as neither is any other means whatsoever) yet as it
                    leads to that end—the establishing anew the law of love in our hearts—and as in
                    the present state of things it is the only means under heaven for effecting it,
                    it is on that account an unspeakable blessing to man, and of unspeakable value

                    important way of ‘establishing the law’; namely, the establishing it in our own
                    hearts and lives. Indeed, without this, what would all the rest avail? We might
                    establish it by our doctrine; we might preach it in its whole extent; might
                    explain and enforce every part of it. We might open it in its most spiritual
                    meaning, and declare the mysteries of the kingdom;<note place="foot"

                    might preach Christ in all his offices, and faith in Christ as opening all the
                    treasures of his love. And yet, all this time, if the law we preached were not
                    established in our hearts we should be of no more account before God than
                    ‘sounding brass or tinkling cymbals’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn56" n="56"><p

                    the law in our own hearts so that it may have its full influence on our lives?
                    And this can only be done by faith.</p>
                <p>Faith alone it is which effectually answers this end, as we learn from daily

                    and our affections are more and more loosened from earth and fixed on things
                    above. So that faith in general is the most direct and effectual means of
                    promoting all righteousness and true holiness; of establishing the holy and
                    spiritual law in the hearts of them that believe.</p>
                <p n="3">3. And by faith, taken in its more particular meaning for a confidence in a

                    more effectual manner. For there is no motive which so powerfully inclines us to
                    love God as the sense of the love of God in Christ. Nothing enables us like a
                    piercing conviction of this to give our hearts to him who was given for us. And
                    from this principle of grateful love to God arises love to our brother also.
                    Neither can we avoid loving our neighbour, if we truly believe the love
                    wherewith God hath loved us. Now this love to man, grounded on faith and love to
                    God, ‘worketh no ill to our neighbour’.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn61" n="61"

                    whatever he had then shown us, by a greater tenderness of conscience, and a more
                    exquisite sensibility of sin. Walking now with joy and not with fear, in a

                    may be fulfilled, both in you, by you, and upon you. Now watch and pray that you
                    may sin no more, that you may see and shun the least transgression of his law.
                    You see the motes which you could not see before when the sun shines into a dark

                    in every respect according to the light you have received. Now be zealous to
                    receive more light daily, more of the knowledge and love of God, more of the

                    use all the knowledge and love and life and power you have already attained. So
                    shall you continually go on from faith to faith. So shall you daily increase in
                    holy love, till faith is swallowed up in sight, and the law of love established
                    to all eternity.</p>
